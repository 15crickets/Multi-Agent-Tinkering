Question: The sanctions against the school were a punishing blow, and they seemed to what the efforts the school had made to change?
Answers:
A. ignore
B. enforce
C. authoritarian
D. yell at
E. avoid

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Type of question:
- Fill-in-the-blank/contextual vocabulary choice. The task is to supply a verb or verb phrase that logically completes the sentence.

Key entities and relationships:
- Entity 1: “The sanctions against the school” — characterized as “a punishing blow.”
- Entity 2: “the efforts the school had made to change” — prior positive actions by the school.
- Relationship: The sanctions’ perceived effect on those efforts. The clause “they seemed to ____ the efforts” implies the sanctions had a negative or nullifying impact on the school’s reform efforts.

Constraints and hints:
- Tone: “punishing blow” signals harm or setback.
- Logical fit: The missing verb should convey negation, reversal, dismissal, or weakening of the efforts.
- Grammatical fit: Verb that takes a direct object (“the efforts”) after “seemed to.”

Candidate answer characteristics (for the Solver to choose among):
- Verbs like “undermine,” “negate,” “nullify,” “invalidate,” “discount,” “dismiss,” or “erase” fit both meaning and syntax.
- Slight nuance differences:
  - “undermine/undercut” = weaken the effectiveness of the efforts.
  - “negate/nullify/invalidate” = render the efforts ineffective or as if they didn’t count.
  - “discount/dismiss” = treat the efforts as unimportant or insufficient.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
We need a verb that captures the sanctions having a negative or dismissive effect on the school’s reform efforts. Among the choices, “ignore” best fits the idea that the sanctions discounted or dismissed those efforts. Other options either don’t fit grammatically (authoritarian), don’t take “the efforts” naturally as an object (avoid), or don’t match the context (enforce, yell at).

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “Ignore” best fits the context and grammar: the sanctions, being a punishing blow, seemed to disregard or discount the school’s efforts. The other options are ungrammatical or illogical here.

Question: Sammy wanted to go to where the people were.  Where might he go?
Answers:
A. race track
B. populated areas
C. the desert
D. apartment
E. roadblock

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis Plan for Solver

1) Question type
- Open-ended commonsense inference (goal-oriented “where” question)
- Seeks a likely destination based on a stated desire

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: Sammy (a person)
- Goal/constraint: wants to be “where the people were” (i.e., among many people)
- Relationship: Choose a location characterized by high population density or crowds

3) Constraints/hints
- No specific context (time, event, age) provided
- Singular phrasing “Where might he go?” suggests one typical/most probable location
- Everyday, general-knowledge setting implied

4) Candidate answer characteristics
- A common place known for many people
- Concise noun phrase

5) Potential candidate locations (ranked by general plausibility)
- The city (most general/population-dense)
- The mall/shopping mall (commonly crowded public place)
- The market (busy public area)
- A stadium/arena (crowded during events; more context-dependent)
- A park (can be busy but less universally crowded)

6) Expected final answer format
- Short, singular location phrase (e.g., “the city”)

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Sammy wants to be where many people are. Among the options, "populated areas" directly denotes places with lots of people, making it the most generally correct choice. Other options are either sparsely populated (the desert), too specific or private (apartment), event-dependent (race track), or not typically a gathering place (roadblock).

Final Answer: B

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
B

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. "Populated areas" directly matches the goal of being where many people are, whereas the other options are either sparse, private, or situational.

Question: To locate a choker not located in a jewelry box or boutique where would you go?
Answers:
A. jewelry store
B. neck
C. jewlery box
D. jewelry box
E. boutique

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis plan for the Solver

1) Question type
- Riddle/wordplay-style “where would you find X?” question
- Seeks an alternative, non-obvious location based on a polysemous term (“choker”)

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: “choker”
  - Primary/common meaning: a short necklace
  - Other meanings: dog training collar (“choke chain”), logging cable (“choker” in forestry), a person who fails under pressure (sports “choker”), mechanical “choke” (carburetor), plant-related terms (e.g., chokecherry)
- Excluded locations: “jewelry box” and “boutique” (standard jewelry contexts)
- Relationship: Find a location where a “choker” would be found that is not a jewelry context

3) Constraints and hints
- The explicit exclusions strongly hint the intended meaning is not the jewelry necklace
- The form “where would you go?” implies a physical place one could visit (e.g., a type of store or venue)
- The most everyday, plausible non-jewelry sense likely points to a retail location associated with that alternate meaning

4) Likely interpretations to consider (without choosing an answer)
- Pet store or animal-supply shop (for a dog “choke chain”/training collar)
- Auto parts store or mechanic (for a carburetor choke component—though “choker” is less standard)
- Logging/forestry site or equipment supplier (for a logging “choker” cable—specialized)
- Sports venue or discussion (a “choker” as a person—less a place to “go” to find one intentionally)
- Closet/costume shop/thrift store (still apparel-accessory context, but not jewelry box/boutique)

5) Disambiguation questions (if clarification is allowed)
- Are we looking for a retail store, a profession/industry setting, or any general location?
- Is this a riddle intending a common everyday alternate meaning (e.g., pet supplies) or a specialized term (e.g., forestry)?

6) Recommendation for Solver’s approach
- Prefer the most common, accessible non-jewelry interpretation that maps cleanly to a physical place someone can “go”
- Provide one concise location and a brief justification referencing the non-jewelry meaning and the exclusions

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
A choker is a necklace that’s worn, so if it’s not in a jewelry box or boutique, you’d find it on a person’s neck.

Final Answer: B

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
B

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Given the options, if a choker isn't in a jewelry box or boutique, the most logical place to find it is being worn on the neck.

Question: Google Maps and other highway and street GPS services have replaced what?
Answers:
A. united states
B. mexico
C. countryside
D. atlas
E. oceans

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- General knowledge/definition with a “replacement/obsolescence” framing (what X has replaced)
- Seeks a concise noun/noun phrase

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity A: Google Maps
- Entity B: Other highway and street GPS services (satnav, smartphone navigation apps)
- Relationship: “have replaced” → asks what older tool/technology/function they supplanted

3) Constraints/hints
- Context is navigation for highways/streets
- Likely expects a succinct, broad category rather than brand-specific
- No time period given; answer should be timeless and general

4) Expected answer format
- Short noun phrase (singular or plural acceptable), e.g., “paper road maps” or “printed atlases”

5) Likely acceptable answer variants (for consideration, not to choose here)
- Paper maps
- Printed road maps/atlases (e.g., road atlases, Thomas Guides)
- Fold-out maps
- Physical map books/directions guides

6) Notes
- Avoid naming older digital services (e.g., MapQuest) since the cue emphasizes GPS services replacing pre-digital tools
- Keep the final answer concise (2–5 words)

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Google Maps and similar GPS services have largely replaced printed navigation tools, specifically paper road atlases. Among the options, “atlas” best matches this.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:

Question: The fox walked from the city into the forest, what was it looking for?
Answers:
A. pretty flowers.
B. hen house
C. natural habitat
D. storybook
E. dense forest

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type:
- Commonsense inference about intent/goal (why/how question framed as “what was it looking for?”).
- Implicit cause-effect: movement (from city to forest) implies a purpose.

2) Key entities and relationships:
- Entity: “the fox” (subject; pronoun “it” refers to the fox).
- Locations: “city” (origin) and “forest” (destination).
- Action: “walked from [origin] into [destination]” (directed movement).
- Relationship: Movement suggests seeking something more likely found in the forest than in the city.

3) Constraints and hints:
- Minimal context; relies on general world knowledge about fox behavior and habitats.
- Forest implies natural habitat/resources (e.g., prey, shelter, safety).
- City-to-forest transition suggests the fox is intentionally moving toward a place with typical fox needs.
- The question expects a concise, likely singular purpose (most prototypical/commonsense answer).

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Reasoning:
- The fox moved from the city to the forest, implying it sought something found in the forest rather than the city.
- Using commonsense about fox behavior and habitats, the most prototypical goal is to reach its natural habitat.

Final Answer: C

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
C

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. A fox leaving the city for the forest is most plausibly seeking its natural habitat rather than flowers, a hen house, a storybook, or specifically a “dense forest.”

Question: What home entertainment equipment requires cable?
Answers:
A. radio shack
B. substation
C. cabinet
D. television
E. desk

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Question type
- WH-detail retrieval question asking for a specific noun (a piece of equipment). Not inferential; expects an exact item mentioned in the source.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: “home entertainment equipment”
- Attribute/condition: “requires cable”
- Relationship: Identify which item in the described/listed equipment explicitly needs a cable connection/service to function.

3) Constraints and hints
- Answer should be a concise noun phrase (the equipment name) as stated in the source text.
- Look for explicit cues like “requires cable,” “needs a cable connection,” “requires a cable subscription,” “connects via coaxial/CATV,” or “set-top box from the cable provider.”
- Disambiguate from items that can use alternatives (e.g., streaming devices using Wi‑Fi) and choose the one explicitly tied to cable.
- If multiple items are mentioned, select the one uniquely requiring cable rather than optionally supporting it.

Proposed steps for the Solver
- Scan the source/passage for the section listing home entertainment equipment.
- Identify all items mentioned (e.g., TV, cable box/set-top box, DVR, cable modem, etc.).
- Find phrases indicating a hard requirement for cable service/connection.
- Choose the item with explicit necessity (not optional).
- Return the exact term used in the source (e.g., “cable box,” “set-top box,” “cable DVR”) as a concise answer.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Among the options, the only item that is home entertainment equipment and commonly associated with requiring cable is the television. The others are not home entertainment devices or do not require cable.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:

Question: The only baggage the woman checked was a drawstring bag, where was she heading with it?
Answers:
A. garbage can
B. military
C. jewelry store
D. safe
E. airport

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis Plan for Solver

1) Question type
- Commonsense/location inference (“Where was she heading?”)
- Requires identifying the most plausible destination from a contextual cue

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: “the woman”
- Object: “a drawstring bag”
- Action/phrase: “the only baggage she checked”
- Relationship: The type of bag (drawstring) suggests a specific kind of activity/location she’s likely going to

3) Constraints and hints
- Drawstring bags are commonly used for gym/fitness activities, sports practice, or swimming; they’re lightweight and used to carry workout clothes, shoes, or a towel.
- The phrasing “the only baggage she checked” likely aims to highlight minimal gear appropriate for a quick activity rather than travel. “Checked baggage” in an airport context is atypical for a drawstring bag.
- The question expects a single, concise destination/location.
- Most plausible, high-probability inference: the gym (alternatives: the pool, sports practice), but choose one most conventional association.

Expected answer format
- A short location phrase, likely: “the gym.”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The phrase “the only baggage she checked” strongly implies an airport context, since checking baggage is associated with air travel. While a drawstring bag is typically for gym/sports, none of the options reflect that. Among the choices, only “airport” aligns with checking baggage.

Final Answer: E

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
E

CRITIC REASONING:

Question: The forgotten leftovers had gotten quite old, he found it covered in mold in the back of his what?
Answers:
A. carpet
B. refrigerator
C. breadbox
D. fridge
E. coach

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
- Question type: Fill-in-the-blank / commonsense completion (contextual clue inference)

- Key entities:
  - Forgotten leftovers (cooked food stored after a meal)
  - Mold (indicates spoilage over time)
  - Location: “back of his ___”

- Relationships:
  - Leftovers are typically stored in a cold storage appliance.
  - Being “forgotten” and “quite old” suggests they were out of sight.
  - “Covered in mold” implies prolonged storage in a damp, cool environment where food is commonly kept.

- Constraints and hints:
  - Phrase “back of his” implies a common household item with depth where items can be pushed to the back.
  - “Leftovers” strongly implies refrigeration rather than pantry/freezer.
  - Common idiom: “the back of the fridge.”

- Likely answer characteristics:
  - A single noun or short noun phrase.
  - Most plausible: a household cold storage appliance where leftovers are kept.
  - Candidate(s): “fridge” or “refrigerator” (with “fridge” being the more colloquial/expected form).

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Leftovers are commonly stored in a cold storage appliance, and being “forgotten” and “quite old” suggests they were pushed to the back. The common phrase is “the back of the fridge,” making “fridge” the most natural choice.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Forgotten leftovers covered in mold are typically found at the back of a fridge; “back of the fridge” is a common phrase. Both refrigerator and fridge fit, but “fridge” is the more natural choice.

Answers:
A. shirt pocket
B. calligrapher's hand
C. inkwell
D. desk drawer
E. blotter

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis:

1) Question type:
- Simple factual recall/common-knowledge (object identification). Likely expects a short noun phrase.

2) Key entities and relationships:
- Entities: people (users), fountain pen, extra ink
- Relationship: People use [object] to absorb extra ink from a fountain pen.

3) Constraints/hints:
- Context specifically mentions fountain pens, which traditionally use a specific absorbent material/tool.
- Likely a concise, single common term is expected (e.g., a specific paper/tool used for absorbing ink).
- Traditional/standard term: "blotting paper" (also known as a "blotter").

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
People use blotting paper, commonly called a blotter, to absorb excess fountain pen ink. Among the options, “blotter” matches this traditional tool.

Final Answer: E

Question: Where is a business restaurant likely to be located?
Answers:
A. town
B. at hotel
C. mall
D. business sector
E. yellow pages

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis:
1) Question type: Common-sense/location identification; asking for the typical setting where something is usually found.
2) Key entities and relationships:
   - Entity: "business restaurant" (a restaurant catering to business clientele/meetings)
   - Relationship: typical/likely location where such restaurants are situated
3) Constraints/hints:
   - Seeks a general, common-location answer (not a specific address)
   - Likely a short noun phrase
   - The term “business” hints at proximity to offices/commercial activity

Guidance for Solver:
- Provide a concise, general location (e.g., “in the business district”).
- Avoid over-specific answers; no need for examples or explanation.
- Prefer the most generic, high-probability phrasing: “business district” or “downtown area near offices.”
- Output as a short noun phrase, singular.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
A "business restaurant" caters to business clientele and meetings, so it is most likely situated where offices and commercial activity are concentrated, i.e., the business sector.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:

Question: Where do you put your grapes just before checking out?
Answers:
A. mouth
B. grocery cart
C. super market
D. fruit basket
E. fruit market

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis Plan for Solver

1) Question type
- Commonsense, single-answer “where” question about everyday sequence of actions.
- Implicit process reasoning (shopping workflow just before checkout).

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: grapes (a grocery item).
- Actor: “you” (shopper).
- Context/location: grocery store checkout process.
- Temporal cue: “just before checking out” indicates the step immediately prior to paying the cashier.

3) Constraints and hints
- “Just before checking out” narrows the step to the moment at the register when items are transferred for scanning.
- Typical sequence: items are in a cart/basket while shopping, then moved onto the checkout area for scanning.
- Common, specific target location at this phase is the conveyor belt (or checkout counter surface) where items are placed before scanning.

4) Candidate answers and selection criteria
- Shopping cart/basket: used while shopping, but not “just before checking out” if you’re about to pay; items are typically moved off it.
- Checkout counter/conveyor belt: the standard place you put items immediately before they are scanned.
- Most precise/common phrasing: “on the conveyor belt.”

5) Output guidance for Solver
- Provide a concise location phrase reflecting the immediate pre-checkout step, e.g., “on the conveyor belt.”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The step just before paying is when items are moved from where they were kept during shopping onto the checkout area. Since the conveyor belt isn’t an option, the closest correct choice is where they were held immediately prior to that: the grocery cart.

Final Answer: B

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
B

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. While the ideal spot just before scanning is the conveyor belt (not an option), the best available choice is where the grapes are kept right up until that point: the grocery cart.

Question: Before getting a divorce, what did the wife feel who was doing all the work?
Answers:
A. harder
B. anguish
C. bitterness
D. tears
E. sadness

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis Plan for Solver

1) Question type
- Wh-question (what): asks for a specific feeling/emotion.
- Reading comprehension with temporal and relative clause constraints.
- Coreference resolution: “who was doing all the work” modifies “the wife.”

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: the wife.
- Relationship: the wife was the one doing all the work.
- Event/timeframe: before getting a divorce.
- Target information: what the wife felt (an emotion or state) during that timeframe.

3) Constraints and hints
- The answer must reflect the time “before getting a divorce,” not after.
- The feeling must be directly attributed to the wife who was doing all the work.
- Likely a concise noun/adjective phrase (e.g., “unappreciated,” “overwhelmed,” “resentful”).
- Prefer exact wording from the source text; do not infer beyond what’s stated.
- If multiple feelings are listed, select the one explicitly tied to “before the divorce.”

Suggested steps
- Locate sentences mentioning “divorce” and “wife.”
- Within nearby context, find mention that she was “doing all the work” (or synonyms: all the chores, everything herself, etc.).
- Extract the explicit feeling the wife “felt” (look for verbs like “felt,” “was feeling,” or descriptors linked to her emotional state).
- Return the exact phrase used in the text, kept concise.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question asks for the specific emotion the wife (who was doing all the work) felt before getting a divorce. Among the options, “bitterness” is the precise emotion and best matches typical phrasing; “harder” isn’t a feeling, and “tears” is not an emotion. “Anguish” and “sadness” are emotions but are less likely than the commonly expressed “bitterness” in this context.

Final Answer: C

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
C

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I don’t fully agree. While eliminating A (“harder”) and D (“tears”) is reasonable, choosing C (“bitterness”) over B (“anguish”) or E (“sadness”) is speculative without the source text. Multiple emotions fit; no evidence is provided for “bitterness” specifically.

Question: Johnny sat on a bench and relaxed after doing a lot of work on his hobby.  Where is he?
Answers:
A. state park
B. bus depot
C. garden
D. gym
E. rest area

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Commonsense inference / location question (single short answer expected)

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: Johnny (agent)
- Action: sat on a bench and relaxed
- Context: after doing a lot of work on his hobby
- Target: infer the location referred to by “Where is he?”

3) Constraints and hints
- “sat on a bench” implies a resting place; “bench” typically evokes a park bench, garden bench, or possibly a workbench
- “relaxed” suggests a leisure/rest setting rather than continuing work
- “after doing a lot of work on his hobby” provides causal context but not the location; hobby could occur elsewhere, with the bench being the resting place

4) Ambiguities to consider
- Bench vs. workbench: The phrasing “sat on a bench and relaxed” leans toward a sitting bench (park/garden) rather than a workbench
- Possible locations: park, garden/yard, workshop (if “bench” were “workbench”), museum or gym benches are less likely

5) Likely candidate answers (ranked by typicality)
- Park (most prototypical for “bench” + relaxing)
- Garden/yard
- Workshop (if interpreting “bench” as workbench, but less compatible with “relaxed”)

6) Expected output format
- A concise location noun phrase (e.g., “the park”)

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
He sat on a bench to relax, which most typically suggests a park setting rather than a bus depot, gym, or highway rest area. Among the choices, a state park best matches the prototypical “bench + relax” context and aligns with leisure after hobby work.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I disagree. While a bench could be in a park, the clue “after doing a lot of work on his hobby” strongly suggests gardening, making “garden” the most fitting location for sitting and relaxing on a bench.

Question: James was cooling off two quickly.  He would die if he didn't find some way to stop what?
Answers:
A. loss of heat
B. revenge
C. expansion
D. relaxation
E. calm down

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Question type
- Short open-ended inference question
- Cause-effect reasoning based on a sentence
- Requires correcting a likely homophone error (“two” → “too”) to interpret meaning

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: James (subject)
- Process: “cooling off too quickly” (rapid loss of body heat)
- Consequence: “He would die” (implied risk like hypothermia)
- Required action: “find some way to stop [what]” → stop the cause leading to death

Relationship: Rapid cooling (loss of body heat) leads to potential death; therefore, the thing to stop is the rapid cooling/heat loss.

3) Constraints and hints
- The phrasing “two quickly” is almost certainly a typo for “too quickly,” guiding interpretation toward excessive speed.
- No additional context provided; the only plausible lethal mechanism from “cooling off too quickly” is hypothermia, implying he must stop the cooling/heat loss.
- The answer should identify the process to be stopped, not propose methods.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
“Cooling off too quickly” implies rapid loss of body heat, which can be fatal (e.g., hypothermia). Therefore, he needs to stop the loss of heat.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “Cooling off too quickly” implies dangerous loss of body heat (risk of hypothermia), so he must stop the loss of heat.

Question: Of all the rooms in a house it was his favorite, the aromas always drew him to the what?
Answers:
A. yard
B. basement
C. kitchen
D. living room
E. garden

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis Plan

1) Question type
- Fill-in-the-blank / cloze-style inference based on contextual clue (“aromas”)

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: “rooms in a house”
- Subject: “his favorite [room]”
- Cue/relationship: “the aromas always drew him to” → implies a room associated with food smells or pleasant scents
- Action: being “drawn” due to “aromas”

3) Constraints and hints
- The blank is a noun referring to a specific room in a house
- Strong semantic cue: “aromas” (commonly linked to cooking/food)
- “His favorite” suggests a positive association
- Likely a common, singular room name

4) Plausible candidate completions (without selecting one)
- Kitchen: primary source of cooking aromas; most common association
- Pantry: also food-related smells, but less typical as a “favorite room”
- Dining room: could have food aromas, though typically less than kitchen
- Bakery is not a room in a house; other scented rooms (bathroom, laundry room) are less aligned with “aromas” in a positive, food-centric sense

5) Expected answer form
- A single, common household room noun, most plausibly one associated with food aromas (e.g., “kitchen”)

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The clue “aromas always drew him” points to pleasant smells of cooking, which are most strongly associated with a room in the house: the kitchen. Among the choices, only “kitchen” is a room and matches the context of aromas.

Final Answer: C

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
C

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “Aromas” in a house most strongly suggests cooking smells, which draw someone to the kitchen.

Question: Bill is stuck in marsh when a man comes up to him peaking Cajun, where is he?
Answers:
A. low lands
B. new york
C. forest
D. louisiana
E. everglades

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Question type
- Inference/Where-am-I riddle: Uses contextual clues (marsh setting, language/dialect) to infer a geographic location.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Bill: The subject; he is physically “stuck in marsh.”
- Marsh: Environmental clue suggesting wetlands/swamps/bayous.
- A man speaking “Cajun” (likely “speaking Cajun”): Cultural-linguistic clue pointing to Cajun people/dialect.
- Relationship: The presence of Cajun speech in a marshy area narrows the location to a region where Cajun culture is prevalent and marshlands are common.

3) Constraints and hints
- “Marsh” implies coastal wetlands/swamps/bayous rather than inland marshland, hinting at the U.S. Gulf Coast.
- “Cajun” specifically ties to Cajun Country (descendants of Acadians) in southern Louisiana.
- The question asks “Where is he?” suggesting a concise geographic answer (likely a state/region or well-known geographic feature), not a city.
- Minor typo “peaking” likely intended as “speaking,” not changing the core clue.

Ambiguities/Assumptions
- Could be asking for the broader state (e.g., Louisiana) or the cultural/geographic subregion (e.g., the Louisiana bayou/Cajun Country).
- Not enough detail to pinpoint a specific parish or city.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The presence of a marsh and someone speaking Cajun points to Cajun Country, which is in southern Louisiana. Therefore, the location is Louisiana.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Cajun language/culture is strongly associated with southern Louisiana, which also has extensive marshes and bayous, making Louisiana the best match.

Question: What is it called when you slowly cook using a grill?
Answers:
A. backyard
B. restaurant
C. crockpot
D. neighbor's house
E. barbeque

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Definition/terminology query: asking for the name of a cooking method.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: cooking method on a grill
- Action/condition: slowly cook (implies low temperature, longer time)
- Relationship: method name associated with slow cooking on a grill

3) Constraints and hints
- “Slowly cook” signals low-and-slow technique (lower heat, longer duration), often indirect heat.
- Must be done “using a grill,” not an oven or slow cooker.

4) Ambiguities to resolve/consider
- Regional usage: In the U.S., “barbecue/barbecuing” often means low-and-slow with smoke; “grilling” means high heat, quick. In some regions, “barbecue” is a social event, and “smoking” is the technical method.
- Technique specifics: If smoke/wood is central, “smoking.” If using a grill with burners/charcoal set to indirect heat and low temp, “indirect grilling.” Colloquial phrase: “low and slow.”

5) Approach to answer
- Provide the most broadly accepted term first (“barbecuing” or “smoking,” depending on emphasis), with a brief clarification.
- Optionally mention “indirect grilling” and “low and slow” as closely related terms.

6) Candidate terms and when to use them
- Barbecuing: low-and-slow cooking on a grill/smoker, typically with smoke; contrasts with high-heat grilling.
- Smoking: specifically cooking low-and-slow with wood smoke.
- Indirect grilling: using a grill with the heat source off to one side and food away from direct heat, typically at lower temps.
- “Low and slow”: colloquial descriptor for the method.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question asks for the term for slowly cooking using a grill. Per the Planner, “barbecuing” is the broadly accepted term for low-and-slow cooking on a grill/smoker. Among the choices, only “barbeque” matches this cooking method; the others are places or a different appliance.

Final Answer: E

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
E

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “Barbecue” commonly refers to slow, low-heat cooking on a grill or smoker. The other options are places or a different appliance (crockpot).

Question: What type of person typically contracts illness?
Answers:
A. hospital
B. head
C. sick person
D. elderly person
E. doctor's office

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis Plan for Solver

1) Question type
- Wh-question seeking a definition/category: asks for a general descriptor of a person (a noun phrase) rather than a specific individual.
- Conceptual/causal: implies susceptibility to illness (who is more likely to contract).

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: “person” (human host)
- Entity: “illness” (disease/infection)
- Relationship: contracting illness (susceptibility/vulnerability)
- Modifier: “typically” indicates a generally more common or characteristic type, not an absolute rule.

3) Constraints and hints
- No specific illness is named, so the answer should be general, not disease-specific.
- Likely expected in a public health/epidemiology or basic health context; common categories include:
  - Immunocompromised individuals
  - Very young (infants/children) and elderly
  - Malnourished or chronically ill individuals
  - Unvaccinated or non-immune persons
  - Individuals with poor hygiene or high exposure risk
- The answer format should be a concise noun phrase describing the person type (e.g., “an immunocompromised person,” “a susceptible individual”).
- If there is surrounding passage/context, prioritize the specific category explicitly mentioned there; otherwise, default to the most general term used in epidemiology: “a susceptible individual.”

4) Disambiguation strategy
- Check preceding/following sentences for explicit qualifiers (age, immune status, vaccination, exposure setting).
- If the source text defines “typical” in its own terms (e.g., “typically the very young and the elderly”), mirror that phrasing.
- Avoid naming a specific disease risk group unless the context provides it.

5) Expected answer characteristics
- Short, general noun phrase.
- Singular form likely preferred.
- Avoid over-qualifying unless context requires multiple groups.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
We’re asked which type of person typically contracts illness. Among the choices, most are not “types of people” (hospital, head, doctor’s office). “Sick person” is tautological (already ill). The “elderly person” is a recognized group with higher susceptibility to illness in general. 

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Among the options, “elderly person” best fits a type of person more likely to contract illness; the others are not person types or are tautological.

Analysis plan for Solver

1) Question type
- Common-sense/location association question (where-something-is-found).
- Seeks a typical place within a shopping context.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: pizzeria (a place that sells pizza).
- Context: while shopping (implies a shopping venue).
- Relationship: Typical location of a pizzeria within a shopping setting.

3) Constraints and hints
- “While shopping” suggests a shopping mall/center context, not a standalone street location.
- Expected answer should be concise, a common location phrase.
- Most specific/common spot within a shopping venue: the food court (inside a mall/shopping center).

4) Output guidance
- Provide a short noun phrase indicating the location, e.g., “the food court at the mall” (or simply “the mall’s food court”).

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question asks for the typical place to find a pizzeria in a shopping context. “While shopping” implies a mall or shopping center, where eateries are commonly located in the food court. Therefore, the best answer is the food court.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:

Question: When eating everything on the tasting menu, what does one tend to feel?
Answers:
A. full stomach
B. getting full
C. gaining weight
D. sick
E. satisfaction

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Question type:
- Cause-effect/consequence question asking for the typical resulting feeling from an action.

2) Key entities and relationships:
- Action: “eating everything on the tasting menu”
- Subject: “one” (a generic person/diner)
- Outcome sought: “tend to feel” (the resulting physical/emotional state)
- Relationship: Consuming many courses → resulting feeling/state.

3) Constraints/hints:
- “Tasting menu” implies multiple courses and substantial intake.
- “Tend to feel” suggests a general, common outcome rather than a specific individual experience.
- Expected answer likely a brief descriptor of a feeling/state (e.g., satiety/overfullness), concise phrase preferred.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Eating everything on a tasting menu typically involves many courses, leading to a sense of satiety. Among the options, “full stomach” best matches the common resulting feeling. “Getting full” describes a process rather than the end feeling, “gaining weight” isn’t an immediate feeling, “sick” is not the typical outcome, and “satisfaction” is plausible but less directly tied to the physical result of eating everything.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Eating everything on a tasting menu typically results in feeling physically full; “full stomach” is the most direct and common consequence. “Getting full” is a process, “gaining weight” isn’t a feeling, “sick” isn’t typical, and “satisfaction” is plausible but less specific to the physical result.

Question: What does playing soccer for a long time lead to?
Answers:
A. excitement
B. fatigue
C. anger
D. hurting
E. getting tired

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Cause-effect (commonsense physical consequence)
- Seeks an immediate/short-term outcome of a prolonged activity

2) Key entities and relationships
- Cause: playing soccer for a long time (sustained vigorous physical activity)
- Effect: resulting physical state or condition
- Relationship: extended exertion leads to physiological outcomes

3) Constraints and hints
- Phrase “for a long time” emphasizes duration and exertion, suggesting acute effects rather than long-term benefits
- The question uses singular “what,” likely expecting a concise, common outcome (noun phrase)
- Context-free, everyday knowledge; avoid technical/medical jargon

4) Likely answer characteristics (for selection)
- Short, general, and commonly expected consequence
- Examples to consider: tiredness/fatigue, sweating, thirst, soreness
- Most prototypical single response: “tiredness” (or “getting tired”)

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Playing soccer for a long time implies sustained physical exertion; the most immediate, common effect is tiredness. Among the options, “getting tired” directly captures this outcome.

Final Answer: E

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
E

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Prolonged soccer play involves sustained exertion, and the most direct, common consequence is becoming tired; “getting tired” and “fatigue” are essentially synonymous. Either B or E fits, but E matches the phrasing of the question naturally.

Question: Which entrance would you use if you do not want to use the back entrance?
Answers:
A. side
B. main
C. anterior
D. current
E. front

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Simple inference/choice question with a negation constraint.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entities: entrances to a place (e.g., front entrance, back entrance, side entrance, main entrance).
- Relationship: The user explicitly excludes the “back entrance” and seeks which entrance to use instead.

3) Constraints and hints
- Constraint: Do not use the back entrance.
- Implicit hint: If multiple entrances exist, any non-back entrance satisfies the constraint; commonly, the “front” or “main” entrance is the default alternative.
- No additional context provided (e.g., image, sign, or list of entrances), so selection should prefer conventional naming (“front/main”) if available.

Guidance for answer
- If “front” or “main” entrance is an option, select that.
- Otherwise, choose any entrance explicitly not labeled “back” (e.g., “side entrance”).
- Keep the response concise (e.g., “Use the front entrance.”).

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question excludes the “back” entrance; the conventional opposite is the “front” entrance, which is the default alternative to “back.” 

Final Answer: E

Question: You can share files with someone if you have a connection to a what?
Answers:
A. freeway
B. radio
C. wires
D. computer network
E. electrical circuit

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Question type
- Short-answer/definition recall. It asks for a specific noun completing the condition for file sharing.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entities: "you" (user), "someone" (another person), "files," "connection," and the unspecified target ("a what").
- Relationship: A prerequisite condition for sharing files is having a connection to a particular thing. The structure implies: If you have a connection to X, then you can share files with someone.

3) Constraints and hints
- The phrasing “connection to a what?” suggests a single common noun (likely in computing/networking context).
- No numeric or multi-part answer required; likely one word or a short noun phrase.
- Context implies digital file sharing rather than physical, pointing to a general infrastructure (e.g., a broader system that enables connectivity).

4) Expected answer format
- A single noun (or very short noun phrase) naming the system/infrastructure to which one must be connected in order to share files.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Given the context of digital file sharing, the prerequisite “connection to a what” refers to the infrastructure that enables computers to communicate and exchange files. Among the options, a computer network is the system that allows file sharing between users.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------

Question: The accelerator was controller via a hand throttle, and the foot pedals controlled the steering in the small what?
Answers:
A. car
B. fuel system
C. accelerate
D. boat
E. airplane

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Question type:
- Fill-in-the-blank / factual recall from a specific source sentence.

Key entities and relationships:
- Accelerator: controlled via a hand throttle.
- Foot pedals: controlled the steering.
- Vehicle/device: described as a “small [noun]” in which this control scheme was used.
- Relationship: The sentence contrasts control mappings (hand for throttle, feet for steering) within a specific small vehicle/device.

What is being asked:
- Identify the missing noun that completes the phrase “the small what?” in the sentence: “The accelerator was controlled via a hand throttle, and the foot pedals controlled the steering in the small ____.”

Constraints and hints:
- The answer should be a singular noun (or short noun phrase) that grammatically fits after “small.”
- It refers to a vehicle or device where foot pedals steer rather than accelerate/brake, and throttle is by hand—an unusual control layout.
- Likely from a historical/technical context (e.g., early vehicle, specialized craft).
- The solution requires locating the exact source or context to retrieve the precise noun rather than inferring from general knowledge.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
We’re filling in the noun in the sentence: “The accelerator was controlled via a hand throttle, and the foot pedals controlled the steering in the small ____.”

Among the options, the control scheme described—hand throttle and foot pedals controlling steering—matches a small airplane, where the throttle is hand-operated and the rudder (and nosewheel/tailwheel steering on the ground) is controlled by foot pedals. The other options don’t fit this control layout.

Final Answer: E

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
E

Answers:
A. the reward money
B. hurt feelings
C. being found out
D. problems
E. trouble

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis plan for Solver

1) Question type
- Commonsense causal inference with pronoun resolution
- Infers likely concern based on context of deception and fear

2) Key entities and relationships
- Sean: subject who is lying
- The body: object/event about which Sean is lying (implies serious wrongdoing or concealment)
- Emotional state: very scared
- Action-state link: Lying + fear → ongoing worry about consequences of being found out

3) Constraints and hints
- “Lying about the body” strongly suggests concealment of a serious matter (e.g., crime, discovery)
- “Very scared” and “constantly worried” indicate persistent anxiety tied to potential exposure
- The question asks “about what?”—seeking the object of Sean’s worry, not the cause of his fear

4) Likely inference space (do not choose yet)
- Being caught/being found out/exposed
- Getting in trouble/going to jail/legal consequences
- Someone discovering the body or discovering his lie

5) Disambiguation cues
- Most prototypical, concise completion in such narratives: worried about being caught (i.e., his lie being discovered or the body being found), capturing both exposure and consequence.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Sean is lying about a serious matter (“the body”) and is very scared; the most typical ongoing worry in such a scenario is that his lie or involvement will be discovered—i.e., being found out.

Final Answer: C

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------

Question: The drug kingpin told his man to run errands, this was code to go to all the dealers to do what they had?
Answers:
A. park
B. make time for
C. receive instructions
D. take money
E. leave work

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis plan for the Solver:

1) Type of question
- Paraphrase/inference of coded language
- Seeks the implied action behind a euphemism (“run errands”)
- Short-answer completion: a concise verb phrase describing what the man was to do

2) Key entities and relationships
- Drug kingpin (boss) issues an instruction
- His man (subordinate) is to carry it out
- Dealers are the targets of the visits
- Code phrase: “run errands” = visit all dealers
- Object: “what they had” = the dealers’ holdings (likely money proceeds or product)

3) Constraints and hints
- “This was code” signals a hidden meaning; the action is illicit but described euphemistically
- “Go to all the dealers to do what they had?” implies acting upon the dealers’ current holdings
- Expected answer is a brief action like “collect/pick up” rather than a long explanation
- Ambiguity: “what they had” could mean money (earnings) or drugs (supply); common colloquial inference in such contexts is to “collect what they had,” especially money
- Provide a concise phrasing that fits: e.g., “collect what they had” or “pick up what they had (the money)”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
“Run errands” is a euphemism for visiting all the dealers to collect what they had. In this context, that typically means collecting the proceeds. Therefore, the intended action is to take the money.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. In criminal context, “run errands” as code for visiting dealers usually implies collecting their proceeds; “what they had” refers to the money on hand. Thus “take money” fits best among the options.

D. moving
E. exercise

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Type of question:
- Fill-in-the-blank/completion based on context
- Also functions as a causation/justification: why the body appreciated the rest

Key entities and relationships:
- Subject: “he” / “his body”
- Action: “appreciated the rest”
- Time frame: “during the day”
- Causal relationship: The body appreciated the rest because it had been constantly [X] during the day.

Constraints and hints:
- The missing piece should explain fatigue or need for rest.
- Likely grammatical form: a gerund or adjective after “had been constantly,” e.g., “moving,” “working,” “active,” “in motion,” “on the move,” “strained.”
- Tone suggests physical exertion or continuous activity.
- It should read smoothly: “it had been constantly [blank] during the day.”

Expected answer format:
- A concise word or short phrase that fits grammatically and semantically, e.g., “moving,” “active,” “on the move,” “working,” “in motion.”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
We need a word that fits “it had been constantly [X] during the day” and explains why the body appreciated rest. “Moving” is the most natural fit; “working” is possible but less idiomatic for “body,” and the other options don’t fit grammatically or semantically.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------

Question type:
- Cause-effect/comprehension: identifying what entity is influenced by demand to change behavior.

Key entities and relationships:
- Entity: exotic snakes (the product)
- Entity: demand (high demand)
- Affected entity: businesses that would stock/carry products
- Relationship: High demand drives businesses to start carrying the product.

Constraints/hints:
- Phrase structure: “The demand is driving [X] to carry them.”
- X should be a plural noun referring to sellers/retailers (e.g., “pet stores,” “retailers,” “shops”).
- Likely concise answer; common collocation is “pet stores” or “retailers.”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The sentence implies that high demand influences sellers to start stocking exotic snakes. The appropriate plural noun referring to retailers is “pet shops.”

Final Answer: D

D. jail time
E. law suit

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis and plan for the Solver:

1) Question type
- Detail-specific reading comprehension question.
- Asks for a particular consequence involving a specific actor (the victim’s family) and their action toward Joe.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Joe: perpetrator who stabbed a stranger to death.
- Victim’s family: the group that took an action directed at Joe.
- Relationship: The family performed an action “to him” (Joe) as one of the consequences of the crime.

3) Constraints and hints
- The answer must identify exactly what the victim’s family did to Joe.
- It should be a concise verb phrase or short clause (e.g., “They sued him,” “They forgave him,” “They confronted him,” etc.), taken directly from the source context.
- Do not mention other consequences unrelated to the family.
- Ensure the action is initiated by the family (not police/prosecutors) and is described as happening to Joe.
- Use past tense and keep it brief.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question asks what the victim’s family did to Joe. Among the options, the only action that the family would typically initiate against him is a lawsuit. Other options (knife wounds, bleeding, jail time) are not actions by the family.

D. they cannot clean corner and library during football match they cannot need that
E. ground

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis plan for Solver

1) Question type
- Commonsense fill-in-the-blank (cause-effect/goal-action). The action (cleaning dust) is done to achieve a goal (prevent glare) in a specific context (watching a big football game).

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entities: 
  - “he” (the viewer)
  - “big football game” (viewing event)
  - “glare” (undesired visual effect)
  - “dust” (cause contributing to glare)
  - Target object to be cleaned (unspecified; belongs to “his”)
- Relationships:
  - Cleaning dust off an object reduces glare when viewing the game.
  - The object is something he owns and views the game through or on.

3) Constraints/hints
- Context implies watching the game at home or on a device.
- “Prevent glare” suggests a reflective/display surface where dust exacerbates glare.
- Object must plausibly accumulate dust and affect viewing quality.
- Wording “clean the dust off his …” fits common collocations like “screen,” “TV,” “television screen,” “monitor,” or “glasses.”

4) Plausible candidates (ranked by typicality)
- Television/TV screen (most common for watching a big game; dust on screen increases glare).
- Screen/monitor (generic display).
- Glasses (can cause glare when watching, but less directly tied to “big football game” context than TV).
- Projector screen (possible but less common).

5) Disambiguation cues
- The phrase “during the big football game” strongly implies watching on a TV; “glare” + “dust” commonly collocate with “TV screen.”
- The possessive “his” supports “his TV/television screen” more than a shared household object like a wall or window, though windows can cause glare but are not commonly cleaned “of dust” to prevent screen glare right before a game.

Deliverable expected
- Provide the single most context-appropriate noun phrase (likely “TV/television screen”).

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Glare while watching a big football game would come from a reflective/display surface, and cleaning dust off the viewing device reduces glare. The most context-appropriate object is his television.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Cleaning dust off a television screen is a sensible way to reduce glare when watching a big game; the other options are irrelevant or nonsensical.

Question: I have something in my head I want to share, what ways can I do that?
Answers:
A. write an essay
B. organize thoughts
C. speak information
D. summarize main points
E. have information

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Type of question
- Open-ended brainstorming/ideation question
- Seeks methods/strategies (how-to) rather than a single factual answer
- Potentially needs categorization and decision guidance

2) Key entities and relationships
- “Something in my head”: could be an idea, story, feeling, plan, memory, design, concern
- “Share”: communicate or externalize to self or others
- “Ways”: channels, media, formats, tools
- Audience: self, one person, small group, public/online
- Context dimensions: synchronous vs asynchronous, private vs public, anonymous vs attributed, quick vs polished, ephemeral vs permanent, feedback vs broadcast
- Constraints to consider: privacy/IP, emotional sensitivity, accessibility, available devices/tools, time/effort, need for collaboration

3) Constraints/hints in wording
- No explicit constraints; broad request invites a comprehensive menu of options
- Implies desire for practical, actionable methods
- Requires clarifying questions to tailor (audience, purpose, privacy, format)

4) Plan for response
- Start with a short overview: sharing = picking a medium + audience + level of polish.
- Ask 4–6 concise clarifying questions:
  - What is it (idea/feeling/story/design)? Who’s the audience?
  - Need feedback or just to get it out?
  - Prefer private, anonymous, or public?
  - Text, voice, visual, or video feel natural?
  - Time available and desired permanence?
- Provide a categorized list of ways to share, each with examples and when to use:
  - Verbal/synchronous: in-person chat, phone/video call, voice notes
  - Written/asynchronous: journal, note app, email, messaging, blog, newsletter
  - Visual: sketching, diagrams, mind maps, whiteboards, slide decks, mood boards
  - Audio/video: voice memos, podcast-style recording, screen capture, short video
  - Collaborative: Google Docs/Notion, shared whiteboards (Miro/FigJam), forums/Slack/Discord
  - Broadcast/public: social posts, Medium/Substack, YouTube/TikTok, open-source repos
  - Anonymous/private: anonymous feedback forms, alt accounts, encrypted messengers, NDAs
  - Creative forms: poem, song, comic, prototype, code snippet, demo
- Include a quick decision guide:
  - Need quick brain dump → voice memo or notes app
  - Need structured feedback → shared doc with comments
  - Need to visualize → sketch/mind map/whiteboard
  - Sensitive topic → trusted person, encrypted chat, or anonymous outlet
  - Preserve/publish → blog/newsletter/video
- Add a simple 4-step workflow for externalizing:
  1) Brain dump (no filter)
  2) Cluster and title main points
  3) Choose medium based on audience/privacy/time
  4) Share a small draft/pilot, then iterate
- Mention privacy/IP and safety:
  - Avoid posting proprietary ideas publicly; consider NDA or provisional patent if relevant
  - If content is emotionally heavy, suggest trusted contacts or helplines (without assuming crisis)
- Offer to tailor with templates or tool suggestions once user answers clarifying questions.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question asks for ways to share what's in your head. Among the options:
- Writing an essay is a sharing medium.
- Speaking information is a direct way to share.
- Summarizing main points is also a communicative method.
Organizing thoughts is preparatory rather than sharing itself, and having information isn’t a method of sharing.

Final Answer: A, C, D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I disagree. The question asks for ways to share; A (write an essay), C (speak information), and D (summarize main points) are valid ways. B is preparatory, and E is not a sharing method. The Solver only chose A, omitting C and D.

Question: He wanted a house that was gated off from other places, where should he start looking?
Answers:
A. neighborhood
B. subdivision
C. city
D. suburbs
E. street

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Type of question:
- Commonsense/location recommendation (wh-question asking “where” to find something that meets a condition)

Key entities and relationships:
- Subject: “He” (a home seeker)
- Object: “a house”
- Desired attribute: “gated off from other places” (implies controlled access, separation, privacy/security)
- Relationship: The house should be within an area that is physically gated/controlled

Constraints/hints:
- “Gated off” strongly implies a neighborhood or development with perimeter gates and restricted entry
- No budget, region, or size constraints provided
- Looking for where to start searching, not detailed steps

Guidance for Solver (direction of the answer):
- Primary recommendation: “a gated community” (also called a gated subdivision or private/guarded community)
- Acceptable variants: “guarded estate,” “private community,” “secure subdivision,” “managed residential compound”
- Briefly explain that these neighborhoods have controlled entrances and perimeter fencing, matching the “gated off” requirement
- Optionally suggest starting with real estate listings filtered for “gated community” or contacting local realtors who specialize in such developments

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
“Gated off from other places” points to a gated community, which is typically a gated subdivision with controlled entrances and perimeter fencing. Among the options, “subdivision” best matches that concept.

Final Answer: B

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
B

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “Gated off” most closely matches a gated community, which is typically a gated subdivision with controlled entrances, making B the best fit among the options.

Question: Where in Southern Europe would you find many canals?
Answers:
A. michigan
B. new york
C. amsterdam
D. venice
E. bridge

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
- Question type: Geographic identification (general knowledge), seeking a specific place name
- Task: Identify a location in Southern Europe that is famously characterized by having many canals
- Key entities:
  - Region: Southern Europe
  - Feature: many canals (defining characteristic)
- Relationship: Find the notable place within Southern Europe that is well-known for extensive canals
- Constraints/hints:
  - Singular “Where” suggests a specific city/location rather than multiple
  - “Many canals” implies a place whose identity/tourism is strongly tied to canals
  - Must be in Southern Europe (exclude well-known canal cities outside this region)
- Expected answer format: A city (and optionally country) name within Southern Europe known for its canals

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
We need a location in Southern Europe known for many canals. Among the options, Venice is the famous canal city in Southern Europe (Italy). Amsterdam is known for canals but is in Northwestern Europe. The others are not cities fitting the clue.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:

Question: What would a camper need to do before he or she can start cooking food?
Answers:
A. make breakfast
B. go hiking
C. pack or bag
D. light fire
E. grab a match

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Commonsense/prerequisite (before-after) procedural question
- Seeks the key precondition action required prior to an activity

2) Key entities and relationships
- Agent: a camper (implies outdoor/camping context)
- Activity: start cooking food
- Relationship: prerequisite needed before cooking can begin

3) Constraints and hints
- “Before he or she can start” signals a necessary precondition
- “Camper” suggests cooking in the outdoors, typically requiring a heat source not already available
- Likely expects a single, core prerequisite rather than multiple setup steps

4) Implicit knowledge
- Cooking requires a heat source; in camping, this is commonly a campfire or a camp stove
- If using a fire: may also entail gathering wood, then lighting the fire
- If using a stove: set up and ignite the stove

5) Candidate answers (ranked by likelihood for a concise expected answer)
- Primary: start/build/light a fire (have a heat source)
- Secondary: gather firewood (a prerequisite to making a fire)
- Alternative: set up/ignite a camp stove

6) Recommendation for phrasing
- Provide a concise, singular prerequisite focusing on the heat source, e.g., “start/build a fire.”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The key prerequisite to cooking while camping is having a heat source. Among the choices, “light fire” directly provides the necessary heat for cooking, making it the most appropriate step to do before starting to cook.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Cooking while camping typically requires a heat source, and “light fire” is the direct prerequisite. “Grab a match” is a possible sub-step but not sufficient by itself.

Question: What could happen to a paper if you leave it outside even if it does not move?
Answers:
A. one material often recycled
B. ripped
C. saturated with water
D. one dimensional
E. crumpled

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Everyday cause-effect/predictive reasoning
- Asking for a plausible outcome of a scenario

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: a piece of paper
- Context: left outside
- Condition: “even if it does not move” (i.e., not blown away)
- Relationship: Environmental exposure causes changes/damage to the paper

3) Constraints and hints
- Emphasis on “does not move” suggests excluding outcomes like “blown away”
- Focus on effects from outdoor elements (weather, sunlight, moisture, dirt) rather than motion
- Open-ended “what could happen” invites one or a few common consequences

4) Expected answer scope
- Mention one or more likely effects of outdoor exposure without movement, e.g.:
  - Getting wet/soggy from rain or dew
  - Getting dirty/soiled
  - Fading/discoloration from sunlight
  - Becoming brittle/warped from sun or moisture
  - Mold/mildew if damp
- Keep it concise; a single clear example may suffice (e.g., “It could get wet”).

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Leaving paper outside exposes it to weather and moisture; even if it doesn’t move, rain or dew can make it wet and soggy.

Final Answer: C

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
C

Question: Mark's semen was very thick, but after his vasectomy it was also what?
Answers:
A. blank
B. sparse
C. thin
D. clear
E. free flowing

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
- Question type: Comparative/cause-effect with a fill-in-the-blank style ending (“also what?”), expecting a descriptive property after an event.
- Key entities:
  - Mark (subject)
  - Semen (object being described)
  - Vasectomy (intervening procedure/event)
- Relationships:
  - Before: semen described as “very thick”
  - After vasectomy: semen had an additional property (“also [X]”)
- Constraints/hints:
  - The structure suggests a short adjective/descriptor.
  - Real-world knowledge: Vasectomy typically does not change semen volume/viscosity/appearance significantly; it removes sperm from ejaculate. Common descriptors post-vasectomy would be “sperm-free,” “sterile,” or “infertile.”
  - Likely answer format: a single word or brief phrase describing semen’s status after vasectomy.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The Planner notes that vasectomy doesn’t significantly change semen’s viscosity or appearance but does remove sperm, making it effectively “sperm-free.” Among the choices, the best match to that idea is “clear,” as the others imply changes in thickness or quantity, which aren’t indicated.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I disagree. Vasectomy does not make semen “clear”; it remains similar in appearance but is sperm-free. The question likely plays on “shooting blanks,” so “blank” fits best among the options.

Answers:
A. in the basement
B. west
C. solar system
D. beach
E. beans

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Common-sense location identification (open-ended, single best example)
- Likely expecting a short, generic noun answer

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: “place” (location)
- Context/activity: “lay in the sun” (sunbathing/relaxing)
- Relationship: A location that is popularly associated with sun exposure and relaxation

3) Constraints and hints
- Phrase “great place” implies an ideal, widely recognized option
- No specific location given; expects a general, common noun
- Collocational hint: “lay/lie in the sun” commonly evokes “the beach” (also possible: “poolside,” “patio,” “park,” “backyard,” but “beach” is the prototypical/most common)

SOLVER REASONING:

Question: Where would you find a seafood restaurant in the east coast of North America?
Answers:
A. maine
B. boston
C. beach town
D. coastal cities
E. ocean

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis and plan for the Solver

1) Question type
- Open-ended location/recommendation query asking where to find something (seafood restaurants) within a broad geographic region.
- Implicitly a “where to go/find” guidance question, not a single factual answer.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: seafood restaurant (establishments serving seafood).
- Region: east coast of North America (Atlantic Canada + U.S. East Coast).
- Relationship: locations within that region where seafood restaurants are commonly found or notable hotspots.

3) Constraints and hints
- Very broad scope; no specific city, budget, style, or travel constraints.
- “Where would you find” suggests general types of places (waterfronts, harbors, fishing towns) and representative examples.
- Good to provide a concise set of regional examples across the coast (Canada to Florida) and typical venues (piers, markets, boardwalks).
- Offer brief local specialties to anchor suggestions (e.g., Maine lobster, Maryland blue crab).
- Suggest a quick method to find options (maps/search) and ask a clarifying follow-up (preferred country/city, price range, casual vs. upscale).

Proposed structure for the answer
- One-sentence overview: you can find them in most coastal cities/towns along the Atlantic seaboard.
- Bullet list of representative hotspots by subregion:
  - Atlantic Canada: Halifax (NS), St. John’s (NL), Charlottetown (PEI).
  - New England: Portland (ME), Boston/Cape Cod (MA), Newport (RI).
  - Mid-Atlantic: NYC coastal boroughs, Jersey Shore, Chesapeake Bay (Baltimore/Annapolis), Outer Banks (NC).
  - Southeast: Charleston (SC), Savannah (GA).
  - Florida East Coast: Jacksonville, Daytona, West Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Miami.
- Note typical places to look within cities: waterfronts, fishing piers, harbor districts, fish markets/wharves, boardwalks.
- Quick tip: use maps with “seafood restaurant near me” + filters/reviews/local specialties.
- Clarifying question to narrow recommendations (which city/area, budget, casual vs. upscale, specific seafood interests).

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question asks broadly where you’d find seafood restaurants along the East Coast; the most generally correct choice is places along the coast where cities and towns are located, which aligns with “most coastal cities/towns along the Atlantic seaboard.” Therefore, “coastal cities” best fits.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Among the options, “coastal cities” is the most generally correct and comprehensive place to find seafood restaurants along the East Coast, encompassing beach towns and major hubs, unlike specific places (Maine, Boston) or the incorrect “ocean.”

Question: The president is the leader of what institution?
Answers:
A. walmart
B. white house
C. country
D. corporation
E. government

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Simple factual recall (definition/role identification)
- Likely a basic civics/general knowledge question
- Expected answer format: a short noun phrase naming an institution

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: “the president” (likely referring to the President of the United States, though not explicitly stated)
- Relationship: “is the leader of”
- Target entity: “what institution?” (the institution the president heads)

3) Constraints, hints, and considerations
- No country specified; common default in civics contexts is the U.S.
- In U.S. civics, the President is the head/leader of the Executive Branch of the federal government.
- Potential pitfalls: Don’t confuse with roles like “Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces” (a role, not the institution asked), or with “the country/nation” (too broad), or “the government” (imprecise).
- Provide a concise, precise institutional name.
- If ambiguity is a concern, specifying “of the United States federal government” may be appropriate.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question is a basic civics recall asking which institution the president leads. In common U.S. civics context, the President is the head of the executive branch of the federal government. Among the given choices, the closest and correct institutional label is “government.”

Final Answer: E

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
E

CRITIC REASONING:

Question: Sitting to close while watching TV can cause what sort of pain?
Answers:
A. brain problems
B. laziness
C. get fat
D. headache
E. laughter

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis Plan

1) Question type
- Cause-effect question asking for a specific outcome (type of pain) resulting from a behavior.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Behavior: sitting too close while watching TV
- Outcome: causes a certain type of pain
- Relationship: proximity to screen → visual/physical strain → pain

3) Constraints and hints
- Wording suggests a single, common pain type (“what sort of pain?”)
- Likely focuses on immediate, commonly recognized effects rather than rare conditions
- Context implies visual strain from close viewing distance

4) Guidance for Solver
- Prioritize the most commonly cited pain associated with close TV viewing: eye strain (eye pain), potentially leading to headaches.
- Provide a concise primary answer (e.g., “eye strain”), with optional brief note that it can also cause headaches.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Sitting too close to a TV commonly causes visual strain that can lead to headaches. Among the given options, “headache” is the relevant type of pain.

Final Answer: D

Question: Where is a bald eagle safe?
Answers:
A. pine tree
B. open country
C. in washington
D. wildlife refuge
E. sky

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis plan for the question: “Where is a bald eagle safe?”

1) Question type
- Open-ended “where” question asking for a location or context.
- Potentially ambiguous: could be factual (ecology/law), normative (protection), or a riddle/wordplay.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: “bald eagle” (species, Haliaeetus leucocephalus).
- Predicate/relationship: “is safe” (implies protection from harm, legal protection, suitable habitat, or sanctuary).
- Relationship sought: location or context in which the bald eagle experiences safety.

3) Constraints and hints
- No explicit constraints given (no region, timeframe, or domain).
- The brevity suggests multiple plausible interpretations:
  a) Ecological: safe habitats (nesting sites, remote areas, protected ecosystems).
  b) Legal: jurisdictions with strong protections (e.g., U.S. under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act; also protections in Canada/Mexico).
  c) Conservation infrastructure: wildlife refuges, national parks, sanctuaries, protected nesting buffers.
  d) Riddle/wordplay: could intend a clever or unexpected location (uncertain without context).

4) Ambiguities to resolve (clarifying questions the Solver may need)
- Do you mean ecological safety (natural habitat), legal safety (where laws protect it), or a riddle/figurative answer?
- Are you asking about a specific country/region?
- Do you want general categories (e.g., “wildlife refuges”) or named places?

5) Expected answer format
- A concise location/context response (e.g., “in protected habitats such as national wildlife refuges in the U.S., where it is legally protected”).
- Could include brief justification if factual route is chosen.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question asks for a location or context where a bald eagle would be “safe,” which most naturally points to protected areas designed for wildlife protection. Among the choices, a wildlife refuge is explicitly a protected conservation area, making it the best fit for where a bald eagle would be safe.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. A wildlife refuge is a protected area specifically intended to keep wildlife, including bald eagles, safe from harm, making D the best choice among the options.

Question: The game promised it was free, but the child's parents soon found themselves doing what for microtransactions?
Answers:
A. costly
B. captive
C. contained
D. paying
E. caught

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Question type:
- Cause-effect/contrast comprehension. It asks for the resulting action that contradicts the “free” promise.
- Short-answer phrase in gerund form (because of “found themselves doing what”).

2) Key entities and relationships:
- Entity 1: “The game” (claimed to be free).
- Entity 2: “the child's parents.”
- Entity 3: “microtransactions.”
- Relationship: Despite the game being advertised as free, the parents ended up performing an action related to microtransactions. The contrast implies they incurred costs.

3) Constraints and hints:
- The phrase “found themselves doing what” suggests the answer should be a concise action/gerund (e.g., “paying,” “spending money,” “shelling out money”).
- Context of “microtransactions” implies monetary expenditure, typically real money.
- Keep it brief and likely in present participle form. Potential acceptable phrasings:
  - “paying for microtransactions”
  - “spending money on microtransactions”
  - “shelling out money for microtransactions”
  - “forking over cash for microtransactions”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The sentence sets up a contrast: although the game was advertised as free, the parents ended up having to spend money. The prompt “found themselves doing what” calls for a gerund describing that action. Among the choices, only “paying” fits both the grammatical form and the context of microtransactions.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “Found themselves doing what” calls for a gerund; “paying” fits grammatically and contextually with microtransactions, reflecting the contradiction to “free.”

Question: What kind of driving leads to accidents?
Answers:
A. stressful
B. dangerous
C. fun
D. illegal
E. deadly

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Cause-effect/definition-style prompt, likely expecting a short phrase naming a category of driving that causes accidents
- Could also be a fill-in-the-blank style with a single adjective before “driving”

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: “driving” (qualifiers/types: reckless, rash, careless, distracted, drunk, aggressive, speeding, negligent)
- Outcome: “accidents”
- Relationship: Type of driving (cause) leads to accidents (effect)

3) Constraints/hints in wording
- Singular, general phrasing: “What kind of driving” suggests one concise term
- No context, region, or legal framing provided
- Likely expects a commonly accepted term; in some regions “rash driving” is standard (e.g., Indian English), while “reckless driving” is common in US/UK contexts

4) Expected answer format
- Very brief: a single adjective + “driving” (e.g., “reckless driving”)
- Alternatively, a short list could be acceptable if broad interpretation is intended, but the wording implies one main kind

5) Ambiguities/clarifications needed (if allowed)
- Regional/linguistic preference (rash vs reckless)
- Whether they want the most common single cause-term or multiple examples (distracted, drunk, speeding, etc.)

6) Suggested approach
- Provide one concise, widely recognized term as the primary answer
- Optionally, if space allows, acknowledge a couple of common variants depending on region (only if multiple allowed)

Question: The sanctions against the school were a punishing blow, and they seemed to what the efforts the school had made to change?
Answers:
A. ignore
B. enforce
C. authoritarian
D. yell at
E. avoid

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Question type
- Fill-in-the-blank / vocabulary-in-context (select a verb that fits the sentence’s meaning and tone)

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entities: “sanctions against the school,” “the school,” “efforts the school had made to change”
- Relationship: The sanctions are described as “a punishing blow” that affected the school’s prior reform efforts. The verb should describe how the sanctions impacted or cast the efforts in a negative/ineffective light.

3) Constraints and hints
- Tone: Negative/critical (signaled by “punishing blow”)
- Semantics: The verb should convey negation, reversal, or weakening of the efforts’ value/effect.
- Grammar: After “seemed to,” use a base-form transitive verb that takes “the efforts” as a direct object.
- Register: Formal/neutral; collocates naturally with “efforts.”

4) Selection criteria for the verb
- Must express that the sanctions made the efforts seem pointless, ineffective, or discounted.
- Stronger verbs that imply reversal/ineffectiveness are preferred over mere contrast.

5) Suitable verb options (by nuance)
- Undo/negate/nullify/invalidate: “seemed to nullify/negate/invalidate the efforts…”
- Weaken/erode: “seemed to undermine/undercut the efforts…”
- Discount/diminish: “seemed to discount/diminish the efforts…”
- Overshadow/eclipse: “seemed to overshadow/eclipse the efforts…” (less about effectiveness, more about attention)

6) Most aligned with the cue “punishing blow”
- Verbs indicating reversal or weakening (e.g., “undermine,” “nullify,” “negate,” “undercut”) fit best.

A

CRITIC REASONING:

Question: Sammy wanted to go to where the people were.  Where might he go?
Answers:
A. race track
B. populated areas
C. the desert
D. apartment
E. roadblock

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Common-sense inference / destination selection based on a goal
- Open-ended “Where might he go?” seeking a plausible, typical location

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: Sammy (agent)
- Goal: be “where the people were” (seek a place with many people)
- Relationship: Choose a location characterized by high population density or gatherings

3) Constraints and hints
- No specific context (time, event, or setting) provided
- Likely expects a concise, generic, everyday location
- Singular “Where might he go?” suggests one short noun phrase answer
- Preference for a place typically associated with many people

Candidate answers (most to less general/common)
- “the city” (generic high population area)
- “the mall” (common public place with many people)
- “the park” (if busy, but less universally crowded)
- “the market” (crowded commercial area)
- “a crowd” (less of a location; avoid)
- “downtown” (city center; acceptable)

Recommendation to Solver
- Provide a concise, single location noun phrase; “the city” is the most generally appropriate.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The goal is to be where many people are. Among the options, “populated areas” directly denotes places with lots of people. The others are either sparse (the desert), specific and not reliably crowded (race track, apartment), or situational (roadblock).

Final Answer: B

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
B

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “Populated areas” directly matches the goal of going where the people are and is the most general, reliably correct choice among the options.

Question: To locate a choker not located in a jewelry box or boutique where would you go?
Answers:
A. jewelry store
B. neck
C. jewlery box
D. jewelry box
E. boutique

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Question type:
- Common-sense location question (where would you find an item), likely expecting a single, specific noun/location.

Key entities and relationships:
- Item: choker (a type of necklace).
- Typical states: stored (jewelry box), sold (boutique), worn (on a person).
- Relationship: If not stored or sold, a choker is commonly found being worn.

Constraints/hints:
- Excludes jewelry box (storage) and boutique (retail).
- “Where would you go?” implies a physical location/context to look instead of storage/retail.

Plausible answers (ranked by likelihood):
1. Neck / around the neck — chokers are worn tightly around the neck; this fits the exclusion of storage/retail.
2. Person / someone wearing it — essentially the same concept but less specific.
3. Closet/wardrobe/bedroom/dresser — alternative storage, but less aligned with the “not in a jewelry box or boutique” hint which nudges toward “being worn.”
4. Costume shop/thrift store/department store — still retail, conflicts with boutique exclusion.

Recommended answer focus:
- “Neck” or “around the neck” as the concise, most fitting location.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
A choker is a type of necklace, so if it’s not stored (jewelry box) or for sale (boutique), the common place to find it is being worn—around the neck.

Final Answer: B

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
B

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. If a choker isn’t in a jewelry box or boutique, the most likely place to find it is being worn on the neck.

Question: Google Maps and other highway and street GPS services have replaced what?
Answers:
A. united states
B. mexico
C. countryside
D. atlas
E. oceans

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Identification/obsolescence: asks what earlier tool/technology was replaced by newer ones.
- Relationship: “X (modern services) have replaced Y (older counterpart)”.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entities: 
  - Google Maps (digital mapping/navigation service)
  - Other highway and street GPS services (e.g., Waze, built-in car GPS)
- Relationship: Replacement/supersession in the domain of navigation and mapping.

3) Constraints and hints
- Wording suggests a concise, general predecessor.
- Likely expects a short noun phrase.
- Broad enough to cover the common, widely recognized item these services displaced.

4) Likely answer form
- A concise phrase referring to physical/printed navigation aids, e.g., “paper road maps and atlases” or “printed street maps/road atlases (e.g., Thomas Guides).” 
- Avoid overly specific brand unless example is desired; general category preferred.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Google Maps and similar GPS services have supplanted traditional printed navigation aids. Among the options, the concise predecessor is an "atlas," referring to printed road atlases/maps used for navigation.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:

Question: The fox walked from the city into the forest, what was it looking for?
Answers:
A. pretty flowers.
B. hen house
C. natural habitat
D. storybook
E. dense forest

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Commonsense reasoning / intention inference
- Cause-effect (action → likely purpose)
- Single short answer expected

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: the fox (animal)
- Locations: the city (origin), the forest (destination)
- Action: walked from city to forest
- Relationship: Movement implies a purposeful change of environment
- Pronoun reference: “it” refers to the fox
- Implied goal: seeking something typically found in a forest that a fox would want

3) Constraints and hints
- No explicit options; relies on world knowledge
- Forest is a natural habitat with resources for a fox
- Typical fox motivations for entering a forest: foraging/hunting (prey), possibly shelter/safety
- The phrasing “what was it looking for?” suggests a singular, generic, commonsense target; most likely “food” (prey), rather than a specific animal unless required
- Keep answer concise (likely one word or a short phrase)

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The fox left the city for the forest to return to an environment suited to it—its natural habitat—since forests provide what a fox typically seeks (shelter/resources). 

Final Answer: C

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
C

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. A fox leaving a city for a forest is most plausibly seeking its natural habitat, where it can find shelter and resources. Other options are unlikely or contextually mismatched.

Question: What home entertainment equipment requires cable?
Answers:
A. radio shack
B. substation
C. cabinet
D. television
E. desk

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis and plan for the Solver:

1) Question type
- Factual/definition-style question asking for a specific item that fits given criteria.
- Likely expects a concise, singular noun answer.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: “home entertainment equipment”
- Condition/relationship: “requires cable”
- Interpreted as equipment that needs a cable (cable TV service/coaxial connection) to function as intended.

3) Constraints and hints
- The phrase “requires cable” suggests dependence on cable service (e.g., cable television), not merely using cables/wires.
- Likely a common, everyday item in the home entertainment category.
- Expected short answer (e.g., one word or a short noun phrase).
- Potential distractors include devices that use cables (e.g., DVD players, game consoles) but do not require cable service. The intended answer probably refers to a device that specifically needs cable TV service to receive content.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Among the options, the only home entertainment equipment that typically requires cable service to receive content is a television. The other choices are not home entertainment devices.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

Question: The only baggage the woman checked was a drawstring bag, where was she heading with it?
Answers:
A. garbage can
B. military
C. jewelry store
D. safe
E. airport

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Type of question
- Common-sense inference “where” question (destination inference based on an object/context clue). Not a factual recall; relies on typical usage of an item to infer likely destination.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entities: “the woman,” “drawstring bag,” “baggage checked.”
- Relationships:
  - The woman is checking baggage.
  - The baggage is specifically a drawstring bag.
  - The question asks for the destination implied by carrying/checking that specific type of bag.

3) Constraints and hints
- “Only baggage … was a drawstring bag” emphasizes minimal, lightweight, casual gear.
- Drawstring bags are commonly associated with gym/fitness activities, swimming, or sports practice (they carry workout clothes, shoes, towel).
- The phrase “checked” could ambiguously suggest airport check-in, but checking only a small drawstring bag for a flight is atypical, making a gym/fitness context more plausible.
- The question is framed to elicit the most typical destination for someone carrying a drawstring bag: likely “the gym.”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The phrase “checked baggage” most strongly aligns with an airport context. Among the given options, the airport is the only place where checking baggage is typical.

Final Answer: E

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
E

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. The phrase "checked baggage" is strongly associated with airports, and among the options, only "airport" fits that context.

Question: The forgotten leftovers had gotten quite old, he found it covered in mold in the back of his what?
Answers:
A. carpet
B. refrigerator
C. breadbox
D. fridge
E. coach

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Question type:
- Fill-in-the-blank/cloze-style completion framed as a riddle-like question.

2) Key entities and relationships:
- Entity: forgotten leftovers (food)
- Attribute: had gotten quite old; covered in mold
- Location relationship: found in the back of his [container/appliance]
- Actor: he (owner of the appliance)
- Implied context: household food storage where items can be forgotten and become moldy

3) Constraints and hints:
- “Forgotten,” “back of,” and “covered in mold” suggest a place where food is stored and overlooked.
- Mold growth implies a non-frozen environment (ruling out freezer).
- Everyday household setting; singular, common noun expected.
- Rhythmic/rhyme cue with “old/mold” subtly points toward something “cold,” i.e., a refrigerator.
- Likely concise, common phrasing favored (“fridge” vs. more formal “refrigerator”).

4) Candidate answers for the Solver to evaluate:
- Fridge
- Refrigerator
- Pantry (less likely due to perishables and mold patterns, but possible)
- Lunchbox/bag (less likely; “back of” fits poorly)
- Cupboard (possible but less typical for leftovers)
- Cooler/icebox (less common modern usage)

5) Most context-aligned candidates:
- “Fridge” (most colloquial and fits the “back of” phrasing)
- “Refrigerator” (formal equivalent)

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Leftovers are typically stored in a cold household appliance where items can be forgotten at the back and grow mold. Both “refrigerator” and “fridge” fit, but the concise, common phrasing “fridge” is most aligned with the prompt.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Forgotten, moldy leftovers are typically found at the back of a fridge; both “refrigerator” and “fridge” fit, but “fridge” is the more natural phrasing here.

Analysis and plan for the Solver:

1) Question type
- Simple factual recall/definition question (object identification). Likely expects a single common noun/noun phrase.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: people (general users/writers)
- Object: fountain pen (context implies wet ink on paper)
- Action/need: absorb extra ink (to prevent smudging after writing)
- Relationship: What item is used to absorb excess fountain pen ink?

3) Constraints and hints
- Context-specific to fountain pens (traditional writing; suggests a classic accessory)
- Likely a common, singular term rather than a brand
- Expected concise answer (one noun phrase)
- No calculations or multi-step reasoning needed

4) Answer format
- Provide a short, singular noun phrase naming the item used to absorb excess ink after writing with a fountain pen.

SOLVER REASONING:

Question: Where is a business restaurant likely to be located?
Answers:
A. town
B. at hotel
C. mall
D. business sector
E. yellow pages

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Common-sense/prototypical location question (asks for the most likely place something is found)
- Not seeking a specific named place, but a typical setting

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: “business restaurant” (a restaurant catering to business clientele, e.g., business lunches/meetings)
- Relationship: likely physical location/setting where such a restaurant is situated

3) Constraints and hints
- The adjective “business” implies proximity to offices, corporate activity, and professional foot traffic
- No explicit geographic constraints; expects a generic location phrase
- Likely answers should be broad and conventional (e.g., “in the business district,” “downtown,” “near office buildings,” “in a commercial area”)

4) Acceptable answer formats (examples)
- “In the business district”
- “Downtown, near office buildings”
- “In a commercial/office area or financial district”

5) Notes on ambiguity
- Avoid overly specific venues unless generalized (e.g., “in an office building lobby” is acceptable but narrower)
- The safest, most general prototype is “the business district/downtown area” where offices are concentrated

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
A “business restaurant” suggests a place catering to professionals and business meetings, which are typically concentrated in areas with many offices and corporate activity. Among the options, “business sector” best matches the business district/office area context.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:

Question: Where do you put your grapes just before checking out?
Answers:
A. mouth
B. grocery cart
C. super market
D. fruit basket
E. fruit market

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis Plan for Solver

1) Question type:
- Commonsense “where” question asking for a typical location given a familiar scenario (shopping before checkout).

2) Key entities and relationships:
- Entities: shopper, grapes (groceries), store, checkout.
- Relationship: Where the shopper places an item (grapes) during the shopping process immediately prior to the act of checking out.

3) Constraints and hints:
- “Just before checking out” implies the phase while still shopping, not during the scanning/payment step.
- The typical temporary holding place in this phase is a container used while shopping.
- Likely answer targets: “shopping cart” (or “grocery cart”). If alternatives appear, “basket” is also plausible but less universal.
- Exclude locations associated with the checkout process itself (e.g., conveyor belt) or after purchase (e.g., shopping bag, refrigerator).

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question asks where you place grapes during the shopping phase immediately before checkout. The typical temporary holding place at that time is the container used while shopping, i.e., the grocery cart.

Final Answer: B

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
B

CRITIC REASONING:

Question: Before getting a divorce, what did the wife feel who was doing all the work?
Answers:
A. harder
B. anguish
C. bitterness
D. tears
E. sadness

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis and plan for the Solver:

1) Question type
- Wh-question seeking a specific detail (the wife’s feeling/emotional state).
- Likely a fact-based extraction from a given passage (reading comprehension).
- Includes a temporal qualifier: “Before getting a divorce.”

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: “the wife”
- Event/timeframe: “before getting a divorce”
- Condition/descriptor: “who was doing all the work” (ambiguous modifier: could mean the wife was doing all the work, or she felt someone else was)
- Target information: what she “felt”

3) Constraints and hints
- The answer should be a concise emotion/feeling or short phrase directly stated in the source text.
- Temporal scope limits the evidence to the period before the divorce.
- Ambiguity to resolve in context: “who was doing all the work” likely modifies “the wife,” i.e., she felt a certain way because she was doing all the work; verify with context.
- Do not infer beyond the text; use exact or near-exact wording.

Extraction plan
- Locate the passage mentioning the impending divorce or “before getting a divorce.”
- Identify the clause describing the wife’s perception/feeling about workload.
- Extract the explicit feeling term (e.g., “overwhelmed,” “resentful,” “unappreciated,” etc.) as a short phrase.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question asks for the wife’s feeling and specifies she was “doing all the work,” which implies resentment rather than general sadness or anguish. Among the options, “bitterness” best matches a feeling stemming from doing all the work.

Final Answer: C

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
C

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Given the context “doing all the work,” the most fitting emotion among the choices is “bitterness,” which aligns with feelings of resentment from an unequal workload. Other options are less precise or not emotions (“harder,” “tears”).

Question: Johnny sat on a bench and relaxed after doing a lot of work on his hobby.  Where is he?
Answers:
A. state park
B. bus depot
C. garden
D. gym
E. rest area

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis Plan:

1) Question type
- Common-sense inference question seeking a likely location
- Specifically a “Where is he?” location-identification based on contextual clues

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: Johnny (subject)
- Action: Did a lot of work on his hobby; then sat on a bench and relaxed
- Object: Bench (implies a seating location)
- Temporal relation: After completing hobby work, he relaxes
- Implicit context: Transition from activity to rest in a public or leisure setting

3) Constraints and hints
- “Sat on a bench” strongly cues an outdoor/public leisure space
- “Relaxed” suggests a non-transactional, restful environment
- “After doing a lot of work on his hobby” implies he moved to a place to unwind
- Typical default association: benches are commonly found in parks; alternative plausible locations include a garden, plaza, mall, bus stop, gym (workout bench), or workshop (workbench, though “sat on a bench to relax” makes workshop/workbench less likely)
- No explicit indoor/outdoor specification; rely on most common everyday association

4) Guidance for Solver
- Primary likely answer: a park (most prototypical setting for sitting on a bench to relax)
- Note alternative but less likely interpretations (garden, plaza, bus stop) if needed by format
- Keep answer concise, selecting the most common-sense location unless multiple-choice options constrain otherwise

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The phrase “sat on a bench and relaxed” most commonly points to a leisure setting where benches are typical. Parks are the prototypical location for this. Among the options, “state park” best fits that common-sense association.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I disagree. “Did a lot of work on his hobby” strongly hints at gardening, and sitting on a bench to relax fits a garden better than a state park. A bus depot or gym are unlikely relaxation spots after hobby work, and “rest area” doesn’t connect to the hobby context.

Question: James was cooling off two quickly.  He would die if he didn't find some way to stop what?
Answers:
A. loss of heat
B. revenge
C. expansion
D. relaxation
E. calm down

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Type of question
- Commonsense inference / cause-effect question framed as a cloze (“stop what?”).
- Seeks the underlying process causing danger rather than a specific action.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: James.
- State: “cooling off too quickly” → implies rapid loss of body heat.
- Consequence: risk of death (hypothermia).
- Relationship: Rapid cooling (cause) → hypothermia (effect) → death unless the cause is stopped.
- Target to identify: the harmful process that must be stopped.

3) Constraints and hints
- Wording “cooling off too quickly” strongly points to excessive heat loss rather than emotional “cooling off.”
- The question asks for “some way to stop what?” suggesting a general process (e.g., “heat loss”), not a specific tool or method.
- Spelling “two” likely a typo for “too,” no special wordplay required.
- Most direct, generalizable target: the loss of body heat (heat loss). Potential alternative interpretation (less likely) could be stopping blood loss if cooling is secondary to shock, but the text foregrounds cooling itself.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
“Cooling off too quickly” indicates rapid loss of body heat leading to risk of hypothermia and death. Therefore, he needed to stop the loss of heat.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. "Cooling off too quickly" implies rapid loss of body heat leading to hypothermia; stopping the loss of heat is necessary to survive. Therefore A is correct.

Question: Of all the rooms in a house it was his favorite, the aromas always drew him to the what?
Answers:
A. yard
B. basement
C. kitchen
D. living room
E. garden

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis plan for the Solver:

1) Question type
- Cloze/fill-in-the-blank common-sense completion; mildly riddle-like.
- Seeks a specific noun to complete “the what?” based on contextual clues.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entities: “rooms in a house,” “his favorite [room],” “aromas,” “him.”
- Relationship: Aromas (smells) emanate from a particular room, attracting “him,” making it his favorite.

3) Constraints and hints
- The answer should be a specific room within a house.
- Singular common noun following “the” (e.g., “the kitchen”).
- Clue “aromas” strongly implies food/cooking smells; typical source is the kitchen.
- Alternative candidates (less likely): dining room (receives smells but not primary source), pantry (stores foods/spices, fewer active aromas), bathroom (undesirable aromas), laundry room (detergent scent but less associated with “favorite” and “aromas” drawing someone).
- Expect a concise completion: a single noun (lowercase), fitting natural phrasing: “drew him to the [room].”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
“Aromas” in the context of favorite room in a house most naturally refer to cooking smells, which come from the kitchen. Therefore, “the aromas always drew him to the kitchen.”

Final Answer: C

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
C

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “Aromas” in a house most commonly come from cooking, so the room that draws him would be the kitchen.

Question: Bill is stuck in marsh when a man comes up to him peaking Cajun, where is he?
Answers:
A. low lands
B. new york
C. forest
D. louisiana
E. everglades

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Type of question:
- Location identification based on contextual clues (riddle-style inference)

Key entities and relationships:
- Bill: the person in the scenario
- Environment: a marsh (wetland)
- Another person: a man who is “peaking Cajun” (likely intended as “speaking Cajun”)
- Relationship: Bill is in a marshy area where locals speak Cajun

Constraints and hints:
- “Marsh” suggests wetlands, bayous
- “Cajun” strongly points to regions where Cajun French is spoken
- Likely a single geographic answer (state/region/city)
- Spelling “peaking Cajun” likely a typo for “speaking Cajun,” implying Cajun language/culture
- Common association: Cajun culture is centered in south Louisiana (Acadiana/Cajun Country), known for bayous and marshes

What the Solver should determine:
- The specific place implied by “marsh + Cajun” (e.g., Louisiana, especially the bayou/Acadiana region; possibly Atchafalaya Basin or near New Orleans), and choose the most concise, widely recognized answer.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
“Speaking Cajun” points to Cajun country, which is centered in Louisiana, and the marsh setting fits Louisiana’s bayous and wetlands. 

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “Cajun” points strongly to Louisiana (Cajun Country), and marsh/bayou terrain aligns with Louisiana’s wetlands, making D the best choice over generic or incorrect locations like Everglades (Florida).

Question: What is it called when you slowly cook using a grill?
Answers:
A. backyard
B. restaurant
C. crockpot
D. neighbor's house
E. barbeque

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Terminology/definition question: asking for the proper culinary term for a method.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: Grill (cooking apparatus)
- Action: Slowly cook (implies longer time, lower heat)
- Relationship: Using a grill to cook slowly typically means using indirect heat and often lower temperatures; may or may not involve smoke.

3) Constraints and hints
- “Slowly cook” suggests low-and-slow technique (not standard high-heat grilling).
- No region specified (US vs UK usage can differ).
- The method is done “using a grill,” not necessarily a dedicated smoker.

Relevant term options with context for selection:
- Barbecuing (US usage): low-and-slow, indirect heat, usually with smoke (225–275°F).
- Smoking: specifically emphasizes cooking with smoke at low temps; can be done on a grill set up for smoking.
- Indirect grilling: technique on a grill where food is cooked away from direct flame; slower than direct grilling.
- “Low and slow”: colloquial phrase describing the method.

Guidance:
- If the question seeks the general culinary term in US context: “barbecuing” or “smoking” (if smoke is implied).
- If focusing on the technique on a grill irrespective of smoke: “indirect grilling” or “low-and-slow grilling.”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Slowly cooking on a grill refers to low-and-slow, indirect heat cooking, commonly called barbecuing in US usage. Among the choices, “barbeque” matches this term.

Final Answer: E

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
E

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. In common US usage, slowly cooking on a grill with low, indirect heat is called barbecuing, which corresponds to option E. The other options are locations or an unrelated appliance.

Question: What type of person typically contracts illness?
Answers:
A. hospital
B. head
C. sick person
D. elderly person
E. doctor's office

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis:

1) Type of question
- Definition/terminology recall. The prompt asks for a specific term used in public health/epidemiology to describe a person who can become ill.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: “person”
- Entity: “illness”
- Relationship: the person is the one who “typically contracts” the illness (i.e., is capable of becoming infected/ill). This maps to the host component in the agent–host–environment triad, emphasizing vulnerability to disease.

3) Constraints or hints
- The phrase “type of person” suggests a categorical label rather than a description.
- “Typically contracts illness” implies inherent vulnerability rather than exposure alone.
- Likely a concise, standard term used in epidemiology/public health (often paired with “agent” and “environment”).

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question asks for the type of person who typically contracts illness, implying inherent vulnerability rather than a location or body part. Among the options, “elderly person” best fits as a category of people more susceptible to illness. Other choices are places (hospital, doctor’s office), a body part (head), or someone already ill (sick person).

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Among the choices, “elderly person” best fits as the type of person more likely to contract illness due to higher susceptibility; other options are places, a body part, or someone already ill.

Question: Where would you expect to find a pizzeria while shopping?
Answers:
A. chicago
B. street
C. little italy
D. food court
E. capital cities

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
- Question type: Common-sense “where” question (expected location), likely a short noun phrase answer.
- Key entities and relationships:
  - Entity: pizzeria
  - Context: while shopping
  - Relationship: typical co-location of eateries within shopping venues
- Constraints/hints:
  - “While shopping” implies a retail environment (e.g., mall/shopping center), not a standalone street location.
  - Most specific, commonly expected spot within that environment is the food court.
- Guidance for Solver:
  - Preferred concise answer: “the food court (in a shopping mall).”
  - Acceptable variants: “in a mall,” “in a shopping center’s food court.”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The phrase “while shopping” implies being in a retail environment like a mall, where eateries are commonly grouped together. The typical place to find a pizzeria in that context is the food court.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:

Question: When eating everything on the tasting menu, what does one tend to feel?
Answers:
A. full stomach
B. getting full
C. gaining weight
D. sick
E. satisfaction

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis Plan for Solver

1) Question type
- Cause-effect / commonsense inference: The question asks about the typical feeling resulting from a specific action.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: "tasting menu" (implies multiple small courses served sequentially)
- Action: "eating everything on the tasting menu" (completing all courses)
- Outcome: "what does one tend to feel?" (expected physiological/subjective state after the action)
- Relationship: Consuming many courses → resulting physical sensation.

3) Constraints and hints
- Generalized phrasing ("one tends to feel") suggests a common, broadly applicable outcome.
- No specific context (restaurant, portion sizes) provided; default assumption is a standard multi-course tasting menu.
- The expected answer is likely a concise descriptor of a bodily state or sensation (e.g., fullness/satiation), not an explanation.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Eating everything on a tasting menu typically results in a physical sensation of fullness. Among the choices, "full stomach" best captures the common immediate feeling after completing many courses. "Getting full" describes the process rather than the end state, "gaining weight" is long-term, and "sick" or "satisfaction" are possible but not the most typical or directly causal sensations.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. After finishing all courses on a tasting menu, the most typical immediate sensation is fullness; "full stomach" best matches that. "Getting full" is a process, "gaining weight" is long-term, and while "satisfaction" is possible, the question emphasizes a physical feeling.

Question: What does playing soccer for a long time lead to?
Answers:
A. excitement
B. fatigue
C. anger
D. hurting
E. getting tired

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis plan for the Solver

1) Question type
- Cause-effect question: asks for the effect/outcome that results from a specified action.
- Wording cue: “lead to” indicates a causal relationship.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Cause: playing soccer for a long time (prolonged duration of the activity).
- Effect: the outcome/consequence explicitly stated in the source/context (e.g., fatigue, dehydration, soreness, etc.—do not assume without context).

3) Constraints and hints
- The phrase “for a long time” emphasizes duration, suggesting outcomes related to prolonged exertion.
- Likely expects a concise noun phrase as the effect.
- Do not infer from general knowledge; extract the effect exactly as stated in the given context/passage.
- If multiple effects are mentioned, select the one directly tied to “playing soccer for a long time” or the primary/most explicitly linked effect in the text.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question asks for the effect of prolonged soccer playing. The duration cue “for a long time” suggests an outcome related to exertion. Among the options, the concise noun phrase that best matches this is “fatigue,” which is the primary effect implied by prolonged activity. “Getting tired” is redundant with fatigue but is less concise.

Final Answer: B

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
B

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Prolonged physical activity like playing soccer commonly leads to fatigue; “getting tired” is synonymous, but “fatigue” is the concise term.

Question: Which entrance would you use if you do not want to use the back entrance?
Answers:
A. side
B. main
C. anterior
D. current
E. front

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Type of question:
- Simple inference/selection based on exclusion (not fill-in-the-blank per se, but a direct choice using a stated constraint).

2) Key entities and relationships:
- Entities: “entrance,” specifically “back entrance,” and any alternative entrances (e.g., front/main/side entrance).
- Relationship: The user must choose an entrance under the constraint of not using the back entrance.

3) Constraints or hints:
- Explicit constraint: Do not use the back entrance.
- Implicit hint: If only two entrances exist (front and back), the correct choice is the non-back option (typically the front/main entrance).
- If multiple entrances are listed (front, side, main, etc.), select any specified alternative to “back” per the given options/context.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question contrasts "back entrance" with its opposite. The direct opposite of "back" is "front," so if you don’t want to use the back entrance, you would use the front entrance.

Final Answer: E

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
E

CRITIC REASONING:

Question: You can share files with someone if you have a connection to a what?
Answers:
A. freeway
B. radio
C. wires
D. computer network
E. electrical circuit

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Question type:
- Fill-in-the-blank/short-answer conditional statement.

Key entities:
- Subject: “You” (a user)
- Action: “share files with someone”
- Condition: “if you have a connection to a what?”

Core relationship:
- Conditional capability: File sharing is possible if there is a connection to a specific medium/system.

Constraints/hints:
- The phrasing suggests a single common noun as the object (“a what?”).
- Likely foundational computing/networking context (basic digital literacy).
- No additional context about proximity or technology (e.g., Bluetooth, local network).

Ambiguities:
- Could refer to general internet connectivity, a local network, or a specific service.
- Without context, multiple valid answers exist in computing: “the internet,” “a network,” “the same network,” or “Bluetooth.”

Candidate answers (for Solver to choose based on likely curriculum/common phrasing):
1) “a network” — generic and commonly taught in basics: file sharing requires connection to a network.
2) “the internet” — broader public network; often used in everyday language for sharing files online.
3) “the same network” — more precise for LAN-based file sharing.
4) “Bluetooth” — valid for short-range device-to-device sharing but less likely as a general answer.

Assumptions needed:
- Determine if the context is general computer networking (favor “a network”) or consumer internet usage (favor “the internet”).

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question asks what you need a connection to in order to share files. Based on common computing context and the planner’s reasoning, file sharing generally requires being connected to a network. Among the options, “computer network” matches this.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:

Question: The accelerator was controller via a hand throttle, and the foot pedals controlled the steering in the small what?
Answers:
A. car
B. fuel system
C. accelerate
D. boat
E. airplane

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Type of question
- Cloze/fill-in-the-blank factual recall. The prompt asks for a specific noun/noun phrase to complete a sentence.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entities: accelerator, hand throttle, foot pedals, steering, “small [vehicle/object]”
- Relationships:
  - The accelerator is operated via a hand throttle (not by a foot pedal).
  - The foot pedals are used to control steering (instead of throttle/brake).
  - These controls are characteristic of a “small” something (likely a vehicle).

3) Constraints and hints
- The word “small” suggests a diminutive or compact vehicle/object.
- Control scheme is unusual: hand throttle + pedal steering, implying a specific historical or specialized design.
- Expected answer format: a short noun or noun phrase completing “the small what?”
- Additional context/source likely needed to identify the exact term.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The control scheme described—hand throttle for accelerator and foot pedals for steering—matches an airplane, where the throttle is operated by hand and the rudder (steering/yaw) is controlled by foot pedals. Therefore, “small airplane” fits the sentence.

Final Answer: E

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
E

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. In small airplanes, engine power is controlled by a hand-operated throttle, and the foot pedals control the rudder (and nosewheel/tailwheel) for steering, especially on the ground. The other options don’t fit this control scheme.

Question: Sean was lying about the body, but he was very scared.  He constantly worried about what?
Answers:
A. the reward money
B. hurt feelings
C. being found out
D. problems
E. trouble

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis and plan for the Solver:

1) Type of question
- Commonsense inference/reading comprehension
- Cause-effect: given Sean lied and is scared, infer what he would worry about
- Open-ended but expects a single, concise likely outcome

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: Sean (subject)
- Object: the body (implies a serious/possibly criminal context)
- Actions/States: Sean was lying about the body; he was very scared
- Relationship: His fear results from lying about a grave matter, leading to ongoing worry about consequences

3) Constraints and hints
- No additional story context; rely on general social/commonsense reasoning
- "Constantly worried" implies persistent anxiety about repercussions
- Given “lying about the body” + fear, the most probable worry is discovery of the lie/being caught by others/authorities
- Pronoun “he” refers to Sean
- Expected answer should be brief and specific (e.g., being found out/being caught), not an explanation

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Given Sean is lying about something as serious as a body and is very scared, the most likely persistent worry is that his lie will be discovered—that he will be caught. Among the choices, this corresponds to "being found out."

Final Answer: C

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
C

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Given he was lying about a body and was very scared, the most plausible worry is being discovered—“being found out” fits best among the choices.

Question: The drug kingpin told his man to run errands, this was code to go to all the dealers to do what they had?
Answers:
A. park
B. make time for
C. receive instructions
D. take money
E. leave work

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Inference/implicature decoding: The prompt asks to interpret a coded phrase (“run errands”) within a specific criminal context.
- Likely expects a concise verb phrase as the decoded action.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Drug kingpin: issuer of the coded instruction.
- His man (subordinate/runner): the person tasked with executing the instruction.
- Dealers: subordinate sellers in the distribution network whom the runner will visit.
- Code phrase: “run errands” used by the kingpin to signal a specific operational task.

3) Constraints and hints
- Criminal/drug trade context implies standard underworld euphemisms.
- “Go to all the dealers” narrows the action to something done at each dealer’s location.
- The phrase “to do what they had?” is awkward but suggests the action pertains to dealing with whatever the dealers “had” on hand (money/cash proceeds, product/stock, or orders/requests).
- Common coded tasks in this context:
  a) Collect the proceeds (cash) from each dealer (collections/”pick up the money they had”).
  b) Re-up/resupply each dealer with product (drop-offs).
  c) Conduct accountability checks (count product/cash, enforce compliance).
- The most typical reading of “run errands” in kingpin-runner dynamics usually involves cash collections from dealers, sometimes combined with small deliveries.

4) Expected answer format
- A brief, specific action phrase (e.g., “collect the money they had made”) rather than a long explanation.
- Could be one of the plausible interpretations; primary candidate is cash collection, with secondary being resupply.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Given the criminal context and the phrase “go to all the dealers,” the most common coded task is to collect the cash proceeds that the dealers have. Among the options, this aligns with “take money.”

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. In this criminal context, “run errands” as code for visiting all dealers most plausibly means collecting the cash proceeds they have. Among the options, “take money” best fits.

Question: Though he could've kept going his body appreciated the rest, it had been constantly what during the day?
Answers:
A. walk
B. lay down
C. working
D. moving
E. exercise

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
- Type of question:
  - Fill-in-the-blank/inference based on context. The prompt asks for a missing descriptor that explains why the body appreciated rest.

- Key entities and relationships:
  - Entity: “he” / “his body”
  - Action/State: “appreciated the rest”
  - Timeframe: “during the day”
  - Causal relationship: Because his body had been constantly [X] during the day, it appreciated the rest.

- Constraints and hints:
  - The missing word/phrase should describe continuous activity or exertion of the body across the day.
  - Likely a concise descriptor (e.g., an adjective or gerund/verb phrase) that fits grammatically after “constantly.”
  - Semantic fit: it should imply sustained motion, effort, or use (e.g., active, moving, working, in motion, on the move).

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The sentence implies his body appreciated rest because it had been engaged in continuous activity. The most natural completion is “moving,” as in “had been constantly moving during the day.” Other options are grammatically or semantically off (“walk”/“exercise” need gerunds; “working” is less natural for “body”).

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “Constantly moving” fits the grammar and meaning best; the other choices are either incorrect forms (“walk,” “exercise”) or less natural with “his body” (“working”).

Question: Too many people want exotic snakes.  The demand is driving what to carry them?
Answers:
A. ditch
B. shop
C. north america
D. pet shops
E. outdoors

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Question type:
- Cause-effect/inference question asking for the effect of increased demand.

Key entities and relationships:
- Entities: “too many people,” “exotic snakes,” “demand,” “what to carry them”
- Relationship: High demand for exotic snakes is causing/pressuring some type of sellers/retailers to “carry” (stock/sell) them.

Constraints and hints:
- The phrase “driving what to carry them?” suggests the answer should be a noun phrase identifying the type of venue/business that would stock exotic snakes.
- Likely refers to commercial outlets that sell animals (e.g., pet-related retailers).
- The verb “carry” indicates retail inventory, not transportation.

Expected answer format:
- A concise noun phrase naming the type of store/business (e.g., “pet stores” or “retailers”).

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question implies that high demand for exotic snakes is pressuring retailers to stock them. The term “carry” fits retail inventory, making “pet shops” the appropriate choice.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

Question: Joe suffered many consequences from stabbing a stranger to death.   Among them, the family of the victim did something to him. What was that?
Answers:
A. knife wounds
B. buy a gun
C. bleeding
D. jail time
E. law suit

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Question type
- Specific detail retrieval from a narrative (reading comprehension). It asks for one concrete action taken by a particular group.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Joe: perpetrator who stabbed a stranger to death.
- Stranger: the victim.
- Family of the victim: the group that took an action toward Joe.
- Relationship: Consequence of Joe’s act → an action taken by the victim’s family directed at Joe.

3) Constraints and hints
- “Among them” signals multiple consequences; the question wants the specific one attributable to the victim’s family.
- The action must be something the family did “to him,” implying a direct action (e.g., sued him, confronted him, forgave him, sought restitution), not a general legal outcome imposed by the state.
- Past tense; answer should be concise and likely a verb phrase or short clause specifying the action.

Guidance for Solver
- Scan the passage for a sentence where the subject is “the victim’s family” (or equivalent) and the verb indicates an action toward Joe.
- Prioritize actions families commonly take in such contexts (civil lawsuit for wrongful death, public confrontation, demands for restitution, victim impact statements), but extract exactly what the text states.
- Provide the exact phrasing if possible; otherwise a precise paraphrase.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question asks specifically what the victim’s family did to Joe. Among the options, the direct action a victim’s family would take is to sue him. Jail time is imposed by the state, and the other options are unrelated or not actions by the family.

Final Answer: E

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
E

CRITIC REASONING:

Question: To prevent any glare during the big football game he made sure to clean the dust of his what?
Answers:
A. television
B. attic
C. corner
D. they cannot clean corner and library during football match they cannot need that
E. ground

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis plan for Solver:

1) Question type
- Common-sense cloze/fill-in-the-blank
- Cause-effect reasoning: cleaning dust off X prevents glare while watching

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entities: 
  - He (viewer)
  - Big football game (viewing event)
  - Object with dust that can cause glare
- Relationships:
  - Dust on a reflective/transparent surface increases glare
  - Cleaning removes dust → reduces glare → better viewing experience

3) Constraints and hints
- “During the big football game” implies he is watching at home
- “Prevent any glare” signals a reflective viewing surface
- “Clean the dust off his ___” indicates a personal, owned item
- Most prototypical viewing setup for a big game is a television
- Answer likely a concise noun phrase

4) Plausible candidates (ranked with rationale)
- Television/TV screen/television screen: Most common device for watching a big game; dust on screen causes glare.
- Monitor/projector screen: Possible if streaming or using a projector; less typical phrasing.
- Glasses: Dust/smudges can cause glare, but the context more strongly implies the display itself.
- Phone/tablet screen: Less likely for a “big” game context.

5) Selection criteria for final answer
- Choose the most typical, concise term for the viewing surface associated with a big football game and glare reduction (e.g., “TV screen”/“television screen”).

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question is a common-sense fill-in-the-blank about preventing glare while watching a big game. Dust on a reflective viewing surface can increase glare, and cleaning it improves the viewing experience. The most typical personal item used to watch a big football game is a television, whose screen can get dusty and cause glare. Other options like attic, corner, or ground don't fit, and D is not a valid answer.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Cleaning dust to prevent glare when watching a big game most naturally refers to the television screen. The other options are illogical or irrelevant, and D is not a valid answer.

Answers:
A. write an essay
B. organize thoughts
C. speak information
D. summarize main points
E. have information

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Type of question
- Open-ended brainstorming / ideation request
- User is asking for methods or channels (how-to share), not for evaluation of the content itself

2) Key entities and relationships
- “Something in my head”: unspecified mental content (could be idea, story, plan, image, design, music, feeling)
- “Share”: communicate or externalize to others
- Methods/mediums: verbal, written, visual, audio, interactive, digital platforms, in-person
- Audience: individual vs group; private vs public; known vs anonymous
- Context/goals: feedback, documentation, persuasion, collaboration, broadcast, safekeeping
- Constraints: time/effort, skill level, privacy/IP protection, accessibility, synchronicity (live vs async), permanence (ephemeral vs durable)

3) Constraints or hints in wording
- Very broad and non-specific; no stated audience or medium preference
- Implies desire for practical options (“what ways can I do that?”)
- Likely benefits from a concise, categorized list plus a quick decision guide
- Keep suggestions general but include concrete examples/tools; offer clarifying questions to tailor

Proposed structure for the answer
- Brief acknowledgment and framing
- Categorized ways to share:
  - Speak/live: conversation, calls, meetings, voice notes
  - Write: notes, emails, docs, blogs, posts
  - Visual: sketching, diagrams, slides, whiteboards, mind maps
  - Audio/Video: screen/voice recordings, demos, podcasts, short-form video
  - Interactive/Collab: shared docs/boards, project hubs, forums/communities
  - Prototypes/Code: mockups, clickable prototypes, repos, notebooks
  - In-person: workshops, meetups, show-and-tell
  - Anonymous/Private: burner accounts, private links, NDAs
- Decision guide: choose based on goal, audience size, sync vs async, effort, sensitivity
- Quick-start steps to externalize ideas (brain dump, outline, pick medium, share link)
- Optional tool examples per category (e.g., Google Docs, Notion, Miro, Loom, Figma, GitHub, YouTube, SoundCloud)
- Light tips: structure (SCQA/elevator pitch), privacy steps, accessibility
- Offer to tailor with clarifying questions (what is it, who’s it for, how fast, privacy level)

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question asks for ways to share what’s in your head. From the options, actual sharing methods are verbal and written. While writing an essay (A) is one specific written method, speaking (C) is the most general, direct way to share information. Options B (organize thoughts) and D (summarize) are preparatory steps, and E (have information) isn’t a sharing method.

Final Answer: C

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
C

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I partially agree. Speaking (C) is indeed a direct way to share, and B (organize thoughts) and E (have information) are not ways of sharing. However, A (write an essay) is also a valid way to share, and D (summarize main points) can be a sharing method/format. If only one choice is allowed, C is reasonable but not uniquely correct.

Key entities and relationships:
- Subject: “he” (a home seeker)
- Object: “a house”
- Attribute: “gated off from other places” (implies controlled access, separation)
- Relationship: A residential area characterized by gates separating it from surrounding areas.

Constraints and hints:
- Phrase “gated off from other places” strongly cues the conventional term for such residential areas.
- The question asks “where should he start looking?” expecting a category/place to search, likely a concise noun phrase.
- Preferred answer should be specific and common usage.

Guidance for Solver:
- Provide a brief, specific term for a residential area with controlled, gated access.
- Likely answer: a standard term used in real estate.
- Keep the answer to a short noun phrase (1–3 words), no extra explanation.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
“Gated off from other places” refers to a gated community, which is typically a type of subdivision with controlled access. Among the options, subdivision best fits that concept.

Final Answer: B

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
B

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “Gated off from other places” points to a gated community, which most closely aligns with a subdivision among the given options.

Question: Where in Southern Europe would you find many canals?
Answers:
A. michigan
B. new york
C. amsterdam
D. venice
E. bridge

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Question type:
- Short-answer geographic identification (recognition based on a well-known characteristic)

Key entities and relationships:
- Entity: “Southern Europe” (regional constraint)
- Feature: “many canals” (defining characteristic)
- Relationship: A specific place in Southern Europe is renowned for having many canals

Constraints/hints:
- The wording “many canals” suggests a place famously characterized by canals
- Likely expects a single, iconic city rather than a country or region
- Southern Europe narrows options to places like Italy, Spain, Portugal, etc.

Guidance for Solver:
- Provide the most widely recognized city in Southern Europe known for its numerous canals; answer succinctly with city (and optionally country).

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question specifies Southern Europe and a place known for many canals. Venice is a famous Southern European city renowned for its canals. Amsterdam, while known for canals, is in the Netherlands (not Southern Europe). Therefore, the correct choice is Venice.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Venice is in Southern Europe and is famously known for its many canals, unlike Amsterdam which is in Northern Europe.

Question: What would a camper need to do before he or she can start cooking food?
Answers:
A. make breakfast
B. go hiking
C. pack or bag
D. light fire
E. grab a match

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Question type:
- Common-sense/prerequisite sequencing question (what must happen before an action can occur)

Key entities and relationships:
- Entity: Camper (person in an outdoor/camping context)
- Action/Goal: Start cooking food
- Prerequisite action(s): Actions required to enable cooking while camping
- Relationship: Before → After (prerequisite → main action)

Implicit knowledge and context:
- In camping, cooking typically requires a heat source (campfire or camp stove).
- To cook, one usually needs to prepare and ignite the heat source.
- This may involve gathering fuel (firewood) and safely starting a fire, or setting up and lighting a camp stove.

Constraints or hints in wording:
- “Before he or she can start cooking” signals a necessary prior step.
- “Camper” implies an outdoor setting without built-in kitchen facilities.

Likely candidate prerequisite actions (from most to least direct):
1) Start/build/light a fire (or light a camp stove)
2) Gather firewood or fuel (if using a campfire)
3) Set up cooking equipment (e.g., stove, cookware)

How to frame the answer:
- Concise statement focusing on enabling a heat source, e.g., “They need to build/light a fire (or stove) first.”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Cooking while camping requires a heat source. Before starting to cook, the camper needs to ignite that heat source—i.e., light a fire (or stove).

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. To cook while camping, the camper needs a heat source; lighting a fire (or stove) is the necessary prerequisite. "Grab a match" is insufficient by itself, while "light fire" directly enables cooking.

Question: What could happen to a paper if you leave it outside even if it does not move?
Answers:
A. one material often recycled
B. ripped
C. saturated with water
D. one dimensional
E. crumpled

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Concept check/cause-effect identification
- Likely targeting a specific scientific term contrasted with a related one

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: paper (as an object exposed outdoors)
- Environment: outside (exposed to weather: sun, rain, wind, temperature changes)
- Processes: breakdown without movement vs. breakdown with movement
- Relationship: What happens to the paper due to environmental factors even if the paper itself remains stationary

3) Constraints/hints
- “Even if it does not move” explicitly rules out processes that require movement (e.g., erosion)
- Points toward the process that acts in place (weathering), i.e., physical/chemical breakdown while stationary
- Expected response likely a short term or phrase (e.g., “weathering,” “it weathers/breaks down”) rather than a detailed explanation

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question emphasizes “even if it does not move,” pointing to a change caused by environmental exposure without requiring the paper’s movement. Rain or moisture outdoors can soak the paper in place. Thus, it could become saturated with water.

Final Answer: C

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
C

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “Even if it does not move” implies a change due to environmental exposure without motion; rain or moisture can soak the paper, making “saturated with water” the best choice among the options.

Question: Mark's semen was very thick, but after his vasectomy it was also what?
Answers:
A. blank
B. sparse
C. thin
D. clear
E. free flowing

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis and plan for the Solver:

1) Type of question
- Short-answer, likely a wordplay/pun or riddle-style completion.
- Could also be interpreted literally/medically.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entities: Mark, his semen, vasectomy.
- Relationship: A vasectomy prevents sperm from entering semen, making it non-fertile; it typically does not change thickness/viscosity.
- The phrasing “very thick, but after his vasectomy it was also what?” invites a contrasting or additional descriptor tied to the effect of vasectomy.

3) Constraints/hints
- Expectation of a single concise adjective or witty term.
- The setup reads like a joke: “very thick, but after his vasectomy it was also …” suggests a pun connected to conception.
- Medically accurate descriptors would be “sterile,” “infertile,” or “azoospermic.” 
- Punny/joke answers that fit: “inconceivable” (since conception becomes impossible), possibly “childproof.”

Guidance for answer selection
- If aiming for humor/wordplay: “inconceivable” is the strongest pun.
- If aiming for clinical accuracy: “sterile” (or “azoospermic”/“infertile”).
- Keep the response to a single word or very brief phrase.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
A vasectomy prevents sperm from entering the ejaculate, so he’d be “shooting blanks.” Among the options, that corresponds to “blank.”

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. The question is a wordplay: after a vasectomy, one is colloquially said to be “shooting blanks,” so “blank” fits best among the options and aligns with the idea that sperm are absent while thickness can remain unchanged.

Analysis for Solver

1) Type of question:
- Common-sense/general knowledge
- Open-ended but likely expects a single prototypical answer
- Could be seen as “best example” (prototype) question

2) Key entities and relationships:
- Entity: “place”
- Activity/condition: “lay in the sun” (sunbathing/relaxing in sunlight)
- Relationship: A location well-suited/enjoyable for sun exposure

3) Constraints/hints:
- Wording: “a great place” implies a widely accepted, ideal location
- Likely expects a concise, generic noun (no explanation)
- Everyday, outdoor setting associated with sunbathing

4) Expected answer form:
- Short, singular location noun (one to three words)
- Most prototypical/common answer in everyday English (e.g., the beach)

SOLVER REASONING:

Question: Where would you find a seafood restaurant in the east coast of North America?
Answers:
A. maine
B. boston
C. beach town
D. coastal cities
E. ocean

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Open-ended location/suggestion query (informational). The user is asking “where” in a broad geographic region, not for a single factual address. It invites examples, patterns, and guidance rather than one definitive answer.
- Potentially needs clarification due to scope ambiguity.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: “seafood restaurant”
- Geographic scope: “east coast of North America”
  - Likely includes Atlantic Canada (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island) and the U.S. Atlantic seaboard (New England through Florida). Ambiguity about whether Gulf of Mexico or Caribbean count.
- Relationship: Seafood restaurants are commonly located in coastal cities/towns, near harbors, fishing ports, marinas, waterfronts, boardwalks, and fish markets; clusters in well-known seafood hubs.

3) Constraints and hints
- Broad scope, no specific city, budget, cuisine style, or distance constraints.
- The phrase “east coast of North America” suggests covering multiple regions/countries; user may expect examples across the coast, not just one place.
- Best response should balance general guidance (where to look) with concrete examples by subregion and a quick method to find options (maps/review apps).
- Include a brief clarifying question to tailor results (e.g., which country/region, city, price range, style), but still provide immediate value without waiting.

Suggested answer structure for Solver
- 1–2 sentence overview: explain typical places to find seafood restaurants (waterfronts, harbors, fish markets).
- Short, organized list of example hotspots by subregion:
  - Atlantic Canada (e.g., Halifax, St. John’s, Charlottetown, Saint John)
  - New England (e.g., Boston, Portland ME, Cape Cod, Newport RI)
  - Mid-Atlantic (e.g., New York City coastal neighborhoods, Long Island, Jersey Shore, Baltimore/Annapolis)
  - Southeast (e.g., Charleston SC, Savannah GA, Outer Banks NC)
  - Florida Atlantic Coast (e.g., Miami, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, Jacksonville)
- Quick “how to find” tip: use Maps/Yelp with “seafood restaurant” near waterfronts/marinas/fish markets; filter by rating and distance.
- Close with a clarifying question to refine (country/region, city, budget, style like raw bar, crab, lobster, oysters).

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Seafood restaurants on the East Coast are typically found in coastal population centers—cities and towns near harbors, marinas, and waterfronts. Thus, “coastal cities” best fits.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “Coastal cities” best captures the general places you’d find seafood restaurants along the East Coast, covering both big cities and smaller towns near harbors and waterfronts. Other options are too specific (Maine, Boston) or unsuitable (ocean).

Question: The president is the leader of what institution?
Answers:
A. walmart
B. white house
C. country
D. corporation
E. government

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis Plan

1) Question type
- Factual recall, short-answer (definition/role identification)

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: “the president” (implicitly the U.S. President in standard civics context)
- Relationship: is the leader of
- Target entity: an “institution” within government

3) Constraints and hints
- The term “institution” suggests a formal governmental body rather than the populace or nation.
- In U.S. civics, the president is the head of the Executive Branch of the federal government.
- Expected answer format is concise (likely a few words).

4) Ambiguities/assumptions
- If not U.S.-specific, “president” could vary by country, but most standard civics/trivia contexts intend the U.S. model.
- To be precise: “the Executive Branch (of the federal government).”

5) Guidance for Solver
- Provide a concise answer: “the Executive Branch (of the federal government).”
- Acceptable variants: “the executive branch,” “the executive,” “the executive branch of the U.S. government.”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question refers to “the president” as a leader within a governmental institution. In standard civics, the president leads the Executive Branch of the federal government. Among the given options, “government” best matches this institution; the others are incorrect (a business, a building, a nation, or a generic corporation).

Final Answer: E

SOLVER ANSWER:

Question: Sitting to close while watching TV can cause what sort of pain?
Answers:
A. brain problems
B. laziness
C. get fat
D. headache
E. laughter

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Cause-effect, factual recall: asks for the type of pain resulting from a specific behavior.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Behavior: sitting too close while watching TV.
- Outcome: a specific type of pain.
- Relationship: proximity to the screen leads to a discomfort/pain symptom.

3) Constraints and hints
- Wording: “what sort of pain” implies a single, commonly recognized symptom rather than multiple effects.
- Context suggests health/vision/posture-related discomfort due to screen proximity.
- Likely domains: ocular discomfort (e.g., eye-related) or musculoskeletal (e.g., neck/head).
- The phrase “sitting too close” traditionally associates with eye strain or headache; posture could imply neck strain, but the question seems aimed at the most typical, widely cited effect.

4) Disambiguation notes
- If needing to choose one, prefer the most commonly cited single pain symptom associated with sitting too close to screens.
- Avoid broader effects (e.g., long-term vision damage) since the question specifically asks for “pain.”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Reasoning:
- The question asks for a type of pain caused by sitting too close to the TV.
- Among the options, the commonly associated and specific pain symptom linked to screen proximity is headache, often due to eye strain.
- Other options are not types of pain (laziness, get fat, laughter) or are overly broad/not pain-specific (brain problems).

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

Question: Where is a bald eagle safe?
Answers:
A. pine tree
B. open country
C. in washington
D. wildlife refuge
E. sky

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis and plan for Solver:

1) Question type
- Ambiguous/underspecified. Could be:
  - A riddle/wordplay question expecting a witty one-liner.
  - A factual question about legal protection or habitat where bald eagles are “safe.”

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: Bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), U.S. national bird.
- “Safe” could relate to:
  - Legal protection (Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Endangered Species Act history).
  - Physical safety in natural habitats (nesting sites, remote areas).
  - Depictions (on currency, Great Seal) where it can’t be harmed—common riddle trope.

3) Constraints/hints
- Very short, no context. The phrasing “Where is a bald eagle safe?” resembles a joke/riddle setup.
- If treated factually, answer should reference U.S. protections and possibly safest environments (wildlife refuges, national parks, sanctuaries).
- If treated as a riddle, likely punchlines:
  - “On the dollar bill” (or “on money,” “on the Great Seal,” “on a quarter”), implying it can’t be harmed there.
- Best next step: Ask a brief clarifying question to determine if they want a riddle answer or factual information. If not feasible, provide both briefly.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Given the ambiguous wording, the likely intended interpretation is where a bald eagle would be protected. Among the provided options, a wildlife refuge is specifically designated to protect wildlife, making it the best fit.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:

Question: The game promised it was free, but the child's parents soon found themselves doing what for microtransactions?
Answers:
A. costly
B. captive
C. contained
D. paying
E. caught

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Question type
- Inference/idiomatic expression completion. It asks for a concise action/verb phrase that captures the consequence (what the parents ended up doing) despite the game being “free.”

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entities: “the game” (marketed as free), “the child’s parents,” “microtransactions.”
- Relationship: Contrary to the “free” promise, the parents ended up spending money due to microtransactions prompted by the game.

3) Constraints and hints
- Wording implies irony: “promised it was free” vs. actual outcome.
- The question “doing what for microtransactions?” expects a common idiomatic verb phrase describing spending money, typically in a gerund form.
- Likely concise phrases: “shelling out money/cash,” “forking over money,” “paying through the nose,” etc.
- Best-fit answer format: a short gerund phrase indicating paying money specifically for microtransactions.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The sentence contrasts “promised it was free” with the reality of spending money on microtransactions. The action that fits is paying. Other options are adjectives or do not fit the verb phrase needed.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. The sentence contrasts “free” with the reality of spending money; “doing what for microtransactions?” calls for a gerund describing an action, and “paying” fits grammatically and semantically. The other options are adjectives or nouns that don’t fit the construction.

Question: What kind of driving leads to accidents?
Answers:
A. stressful
B. dangerous
C. fun
D. illegal
E. deadly

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis and plan for the Solver:

1) Question type
- Cause-effect/vocabulary: Asking for the category of driving behavior that causes accidents.
- Likely a short, single-phrase answer (common collocation).

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: “driving” (behavior type)
- Outcome: “accidents”
- Relationship: Causal (X kind of driving leads to accidents)

3) Constraints/hints
- Singular phrasing “What kind of driving…” suggests a general term rather than a list.
- Common expected collocations: “reckless driving” or regional “rash driving”; “careless driving” is also plausible. Others (distracted, drunk, speeding) are specific behaviors but may be longer than needed.

4) Recommendation for answer form
- Primary: “Reckless driving.”
- Acceptable variants depending on dialect/context: “Rash driving” (Indian English), “Careless driving.”
- Keep response concise; provide one term unless asked for examples.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question seeks a general category of driving behavior that causes accidents. Among the choices, “dangerous” best matches the common idea (akin to “reckless” or “careless” driving) that leads to accidents. Other options are either states (“stressful”), outcomes (“deadly”), unrelated (“fun”), or not inherently causal (“illegal”).

Final Answer: B

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
B

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “Dangerous” is the most appropriate and general descriptor for driving that leads to accidents; other options describe a feeling (stressful), an outcome (deadly), unrelated (fun), or legality (illegal) which doesn’t inherently cause accidents.

Question: What is eating too much dinner likely to result in?
Answers:
A. tiredness
B. living longer
C. stomach ache
D. illness
E. acid reflux

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Cause-effect/likely outcome question seeking a common consequence of an action.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Cause: eating too much dinner (overeating at an evening meal)
- Effect: what it is likely to result in (a typical, general consequence)

3) Constraints and hints
- Wording “likely to result in” suggests a common, broadly accepted outcome rather than a rare one.
- No specific context (health vs. immediate comfort), but “dinner” and “too much” imply an immediate, short-term effect is appropriate.
- Expected answer is probably a single, concise outcome (noun phrase), not a list.
- Avoid over-specific or long-term outcomes unless clearly the most common association.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Eating too much dinner implies an immediate, short-term consequence. Among the options, “stomach ache” is the most commonly associated and broadly accepted immediate outcome of overeating, more general than acid reflux and more direct than tiredness or illness.

Final Answer: C

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
C

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Question type:
- Intention/goal inference (common-sense reasoning about an action)

Key entities and relationships:
- Entity: a person
- Entities: friends
- Action/relationship: chatting with friends (social interaction)

Constraints/hints:
- No specific context provided; expect a general, common-sense goal
- Phrase “likely hoping to accomplish” suggests the most typical purpose

Relevant possible goals (ranked by likelihood):
1. Socialize/maintain social connection (primary)

Answers:
A. disneyland
B. snow
C. windowsill
D. street
E. summer

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis:

1) Question type
- Common-sense inference / cause-effect leading to location identification
- “Where might he have been?” suggests selecting a plausible location based on context clues

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: Jame (person)
- Entity: Bare feet
- Cause: Sunshine heating a surface
- Effect: Feet burned while walking
- Relationship: Sunshine → hot surface → burns bare feet during walking

3) Constraints and hints
- He is barefoot (implies a place where being barefoot is common)
- Sunshine made the surface hot (outdoor, directly sun-exposed surface)
- The surface is walkable and gets very hot
- Likely, a prototypical scenario where people walk barefoot: beach sand; alternatives include asphalt/pavement/sidewalk, parking lot, desert sand.
- Most context-appropriate and commonly expected answer: beach/on hot sand (since barefoot walking is typical there).

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The sunshine heated an outdoor walking surface enough to burn bare feet. Among the options, a street (sun-exposed pavement/asphalt) can get very hot and fits as a location. Snow is cold, a windowsill isn’t for walking, “summer” isn’t a place, and Disneyland doesn’t specifically imply a hot walking surface barefoot.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:

Question: A fox was thirsty searching for water during the drought, where was he?
Answers:
A. painting
B. hen house
C. california
D. virginia
E. movie hall

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Riddle/wordplay (lateral thinking). It asks a “where” question that likely expects a clever, non-literal location.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Subject: a fox (likely incidental; animal choice probably not crucial).
- Condition: thirsty, searching for water.
- Context: during a drought (implies water scarcity).
- Query: location (“where was he?”).

3) Constraints/hints
- “During the drought” signals that water isn’t available in the real world, nudging toward a trick answer.
- Common riddle trope: “Where can you always find water during a drought? In the dictionary.”
- The fox’s species is probably a red herring; the key is the wordplay on “find water” despite drought.

Guidance for answer
- Likely intended answer: a wordplay location where “water” can still be found regardless of drought (i.e., the dictionary).
- Avoid literal places (desert, riverbank) as they ignore the riddle’s hint.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The riddle’s classic answer is “in the dictionary,” since that’s where you can always find “water” during a drought. That option isn’t listed, so the closest thematic match among the choices is California, which is commonly associated with droughts.

Final Answer: C

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
C

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I disagree with the Solver. The classic riddle answer is “in the dictionary,” which isn’t an option. Among the choices, the most riddle-like alternative is “painting,” since you can still find “water” depicted there during a drought.

Question: What might be the result of a season of successful skiing?
Answers:
A. finish line
B. broken bones
C. broken legs
D. chapped lips
E. healthy body

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Question type
- Cause-effect / result-of-action question
- Open-ended, commonsense inference

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: “season” (a duration of time)
- Action/Context: “successful skiing” (implies repeated success in the sport over the season)
- Relationship: Cause (season of successful skiing) → Effect/Result (outcome, reward, consequence)

3) Constraints and hints
- “Season” suggests sustained performance, possibly competitive context
- “Successful” implies positive outcomes (wins, achievements, improvements), not injuries or failures
- “What might be” indicates non-unique, plausible outcomes rather than a single factual answer
- Expected answer is likely a concise noun phrase describing a positive result

4) Likely answer form (for Solver)
- A tangible achievement (e.g., a trophy, medal, championship, prize money)
- Or an intangible positive outcome (e.g., improved fitness, recognition, higher ranking)
- Prefer a concrete, singular noun phrase aligned with competitive success (e.g., “a trophy”)

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Successful implies positive outcomes, not injuries or discomfort. Over a season, sustained skiing would plausibly lead to improved fitness. Among the options, only “healthy body” matches a positive result of a successful season.

Final Answer: E

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
E

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “Successful skiing” implies positive outcomes over a season; injuries or discomforts don’t fit. Among the options, “healthy body” is the plausible positive result of sustained, successful skiing.

Question: The sensor would just the distance then set off an alarm, the installation expert explained it was called a what kind of sensor?
Answers:
A. near
B. closeness
C. here
D. proximity
E. this

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Question type
- Definition/identification: The prompt asks for the specific name of a type of sensor based on its described function (measuring distance and triggering an alarm).

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: Sensor (installed by an expert)
- Function: Measures/judges distance to an object/target
- Trigger: Sets off an alarm when a distance threshold is met
- Relationship: Sensor uses distance measurement to trigger an alarm when an object comes within a set range.

3) Constraints and hints
- The phrase “would just the distance” likely intends “judge the distance” or “measure the distance.”
- The context is an installation expert describing a system that alarms based on proximity/distance.
- The expected term is a common name used in security/automation contexts.
- Candidate terms that fit:
  - Proximity sensor (generic term for distance-threshold triggering)
  - Distance sensor / range sensor / rangefinder (measures distance explicitly)
  - Ultrasonic sensor (a common distance/proximity technology)
  - Infrared proximity sensor / photoelectric sensor (another common proximity technology)
  - Radar or LiDAR sensor (less likely in basic alarm installs but still distance-based)
- Most natural, general answer likely aims at the category name rather than the specific technology. The description emphasizes distance-threshold triggering (proximity), not motion over time (motion/PIR).

What the Solver should do
- Provide the most commonly used term that matches “measures distance and triggers alarm at a set threshold,” prioritizing the generic category name used in installations (e.g., “proximity sensor”), optionally noting that technologies include ultrasonic or infrared if needed by context.  
- Avoid committing to a specific technology unless the prompt implies one.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The described device measures/judges distance and triggers an alarm when something comes within a set range, which matches the common term “proximity sensor.” Among the choices, “proximity” is the correct term.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. The description matches a proximity sensor, which detects objects within a certain distance to trigger an alarm. Among the options, “proximity” is the correct term.

Question: The man was eating lunch, but rushed when he looked at his watch, why did he rush?
Answers:
A. gain weight
B. late for work
C. heartburn
D. bad breath
E. early for work

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Cause-effect / commonsense inference question. It asks for the likely cause (reason) of a behavior change based on a cue.

2) Key entities
- Man
- Lunch (ongoing activity)
- Watch (time-checking device)
- Action: rushed (behavior change)

3) Relationships
- Sequence: He was eating lunch → he looked at his watch → he rushed.
- The watch check is the trigger for the change in behavior.
- Implicit relationship: time awareness leads to urgency.

4) Constraints/Hints in wording
- The conjunction “but” signals an unexpected shift from a leisurely activity to urgency.
- “When he looked at his watch” points to time as the cause.
- The question asks “why did he rush?” implying a time-sensitive obligation or realization.

5) Inference scope
- Do not assume a specific scenario without evidence; reason at the level of “he realized he was late or time was short for a commitment.”

6) plausible explanations to consider (choose one generalizable rationale)
- He realized he was late (or about to be late) for work, a meeting, an appointment, class, a train/bus, or the end of a lunch break.
- His parking meter or paid time was expiring.
- A deadline or start time was imminent.

7) Expected answer shape
- A concise causal explanation linking the watch check to time pressure: He rushed because seeing the time made him realize he was (about to be) late for a scheduled obligation.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Looking at his watch implies a time-related urgency. The sudden rush suggests he realized he was or was about to be late for an obligation; among the options, being late for work fits best.

Final Answer: B

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
B

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Looking at his watch indicates a time concern, and rushing suggests he realized he was late; “late for work” best fits the options.

Question: The evacuation became mandatory, so what came on the TV?
Answers:
A. advisory
B. mandate
C. soap opera
D. elective
E. optional

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver:

1) Question type
- Causal/consequence inference (commonsense). Asks what would appear on TV given a mandatory evacuation.
- Short-answer/noun-phrase expected.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: “evacuation” (status changed to “mandatory”)
- Entity: “TV”
- Relationship: The mandate triggers a public alert/announcement broadcast on television.

3) Constraints and hints
- “Became mandatory” implies official/government order and urgent public communication.
- TV is the medium; typical consequence is an emergency alert/notice or breaking news.
- Likely desired answer: a brief phrase such as “an emergency alert,” “a news bulletin,” or “an emergency broadcast.” 
- Answer should be concise and generic (no specific channel or program).

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
A mandatory evacuation implies an official order that is urgently communicated to the public via television, typically as an alert or advisory. Among the options, “advisory” best matches what would appear on TV.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. When an evacuation becomes mandatory, TV typically shows an alert or advisory to inform the public. Among the choices, “advisory” best fits what would appear on TV.

Question: The person gave a good hands on what to show how to do the work?
Answers:
A. demonstration
B. garage
C. building
D. barn
E. synagogue

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis plan for the Solver

1) Type of question
- Sentence correction/word choice question (improving grammar and natural phrasing)
- Possibly a fill-in-the-blank for the noun following “hands-on”

2) Key entities and relationships
- Subject: “The person”
- Action: “gave”
- Modifier: “a good hands-on [X]”
- Purpose clause: “to show how to do the work”
- Relationship: Choose an appropriate noun after “hands-on” to make a natural, grammatical sentence that conveys instruction/demonstration.

3) Constraints and hints
- “Hands-on” should be hyphenated when used as an adjective.
- The intended meaning is practical instruction or demonstration.
- Register likely general/professional; aim for clear, standard phrasing.
- The verb “gave” pairs naturally with nouns like “demonstration,” “tutorial,” “training,” “workshop,” “walkthrough,” “lesson.”

4) Ambiguities to note
- Context level (informal vs formal) not specified.
- Audience size (one-on-one vs group) unknown.
- Setting (workplace training vs classroom) unknown.

5) What the Solver should produce
- Provide several corrected sentence options using appropriate nouns, e.g., “hands-on demonstration/training/tutorial/workshop/walkthrough.”
- Ensure correct hyphenation and article usage.
- Optionally tailor choices by formality and context.
- Offer a brief note on when to use each option.
- Optionally ask a clarifying question about context to pick the best single phrasing.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The sentence aims for a noun that naturally follows “hands-on” to indicate practical instruction: “hands-on demonstration” is a common, correct collocation that fits “to show how to do the work.” The other options are types of buildings and don’t fit.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “Hands-on demonstration” fits the context of showing how to do the work; the other options are buildings and don’t make sense here.

C. water fountain
D. bus stop
E. church

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Question type
- Common-sense/location question asking for a typical setting
- Seeks a plausible, generic place rather than a specific proper noun

2) Key entities and relationships
- Activity: “jumping jacks” (a basic group exercise)
- Actors: “some people” (suggests a group context)
- Relationship: Activity-to-location (where such group exercise commonly occurs)

3) Constraints/hints
- Group exercise implies public/exercise settings
- Likely expects a concise, common location noun

Candidate locations (most to least typical)
- Gym / fitness center
- Physical education (PE) class / school gym
- Exercise class / boot camp
- Military training
- Park

Recommendation for solver
- Provide a concise, common answer such as: “At a gym.”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Jumping jacks are a common group exercise, especially in organized training contexts. Of the options, a military base is the most typical place to see people doing them.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Among the options, a military base is the most plausible place to see people doing jumping jacks due to common physical training routines there. The other choices are unlikely contexts for this activity.

Question: The body guard was good at his duties, he made the person who hired him what?
Answers:
A. better job
B. irritated
C. feel safe
D. save money
E. headache

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Question type:
- Cause-effect inference based on commonsense/social reasoning
- Also a fill-in-the-blank style prompt expecting a short descriptive outcome

2) Key entities and relationships:
- Entity A: the bodyguard (male), subject performing duties
- Entity B: the person who hired him (employer/client)
- Relationship: A’s competence at duties causes a change in B’s state (emotional/physical security)

3) Constraints and hints:
- “Good at his duties” implies effective protection
- “He made the person who hired him what?” expects a concise adjective or short phrase describing the employer’s resulting state
- The most plausible outcome concerns safety/security feelings (e.g., safe/secure/protected) rather than unrelated states

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Given that the bodyguard was good at his duties, the most plausible effect on the person who hired him is an increased sense of security. The Planner notes this is a cause-effect inference and points to safety/security feelings as the expected outcome. Therefore, “feel safe” best fits.

Final Answer: C

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
C

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. A competent bodyguard would make the client feel secure; “feel safe” is the most plausible effect among the options.

Question: Learning languages is difficult.  Even in a full immersion environment you're likely to make mistakes, mistakes will cause misinterpretation, which will be uncomfortable, which will cause what?,
Answers:
A. better communication
B. overthinking
C. frustration
D. misunderstandings
E. headaches

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type:
- Cause-effect chain completion (predictive inference). The prompt sets up a sequence of causes and effects and asks for the next likely consequence.

2) Key entities and relationships:
- Entities: language learning, full immersion environment, mistakes, misinterpretation, discomfort (feeling uncomfortable), subsequent outcome.
- Causal chain explicitly given: mistakes → misinterpretation → discomfort (uncomfortable) → [next effect to be inferred].
- Likely relationship pattern: discomfort leads to a behavioral or emotional response that impacts participation/practice.

3) Constraints and hints:
- The narrative implies a negative feedback loop in learning: discomfort tends to reduce engagement.
- Expected next effect is probably a behavioral consequence such as:
  - avoidance of speaking/participation,
  - increased anxiety or fear of making mistakes,
  - reduced willingness to practice,
  - withdrawal/silence, or
  - decreased confidence leading to less exposure.
- The phrasing “which will cause what?” suggests a single concise consequence, likely summarizable as avoidance or reduced participation, which in turn hampers learning.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The sequence is: mistakes → misinterpretation → discomfort. The next likely consequence of feeling uncomfortable in this context is an emotional reaction, most plausibly frustration, rather than a positive outcome or a repetition of misinterpretation.

Final Answer: C

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
C

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. The chain moves from mistakes to misinterpretation to feeling uncomfortable, which most naturally leads to an emotional response like frustration rather than a positive outcome or a repeat of misunderstandings.

Answers:
A. going to jail
B. going to prison
C. beat him up
D. get arrested
E. die

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis Plan for Solver

1) Question type:
- Cause-and-effect / consequence question
- Seeks a plausible, common-sense outcome based on a described situation

2) Key entities and relationships:
- Jim: person who has been killing people repeatedly (implies serious criminal activity)
- Cops (law enforcement): they discovered his actions (“found out”)
- Relationship: Law enforcement response to a known, repeated violent crime by a suspect

3) Constraints and hints:
- “Too often” implies multiple offenses (serious, likely prioritized by police)
- “Cops found out” implies discovery/evidence leading to official action
- The prompt asks what the cops might do “to him,” focusing on direct action by police
- Expected concise, conventional legal consequence phrased as an action (e.g., arrest, detain, charge, imprison)
- Acceptable short answers include: arrest him; take him into custody; charge him; put him in jail; lock him up; prosecute him (though prosecution is by prosecutors, police initiate arrest/charges)

Preferred concise answer format for solver:
- A short, direct action: e.g., “Arrest him” or “Put him in jail.”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The cops, upon discovering his repeated killings, would take direct law-enforcement action. The immediate and appropriate action by police is to arrest him.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:

Question: Where is there usually a fiddle playing?
Answers:
A. music store
B. dance hall
C. orchestra
D. symphony
E. tennessee

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Question type
- Common-sense/location question (activity-to-location association)

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: “fiddle” (informal term for violin, typically in folk/country contexts)
- Action: “playing”
- Relationship: Typical or usual location/setting where a fiddle is played

3) Constraints/hints
- The word “usually” implies a stereotypical or most common setting, not a specific instance
- Using “fiddle” (not “violin”) cues folk/country/bluegrass/traditional music contexts rather than classical/orchestral
- Expected answer is likely a short location or setting (e.g., event/venue/group)

4) Candidate answer space for the Solver
- Event/venue: barn dance, square dance, hoedown, honky-tonk, pub (Irish session)
- Group/context: country band, bluegrass band/string band
- Choose a setting strongly associated with “fiddle” rather than classical “violin,” likely something like “a barn dance” or “a bluegrass/country band.”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The term “fiddle” suggests folk/bluegrass music commonly associated with dancing, not classical settings like an orchestra or symphony. A dance hall is a typical venue where a fiddle is usually played.

Final Answer: B

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
B

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “Fiddle” connotes folk/bluegrass music commonly heard at dances; a dance hall is a typical venue. The other options are less fitting (orchestra/symphony imply “violin,” music store isn’t “usually” playing, Tennessee is too broad).

Question: What is the only was to recover from exhaustion?
Answers:
A. mediate
B. have rest
C. stay in bed
D. run out of steam
E. go to sleep

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis:

1) Question type:
- Direct factual recall/short-answer. Likely expects a single-word or very short phrase.

2) Key entities and relationships:
- Entity: exhaustion (type unspecified: general fatigue, overtraining, heat exhaustion, etc.)
- Relationship: method of recovery (remedy). The phrasing “only way” implies a singular, definitive remedy.

3) Constraints and hints:
- “Only was” appears to be a typo for “only way.”
- Lack of context suggests a general health/fitness statement commonly phrased as “The only way to recover from exhaustion is [X].”
- Expected answer should be concise (one word or short phrase). Likely candidates: “rest” (or “sleep”), with “rest” being the most universally applicable across contexts.

Notes for Solver:
- Provide a concise answer (preferably one word).
- If needed, acknowledge the typo (“way”).
- Given common phrasing in health/fitness contexts, “rest” is the typical expected answer. If you choose to clarify, keep it minimal.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question likely contains a typo (“only was” → “only way”). In general usage, the standard remedy for exhaustion is rest. Among the options, “have rest” best matches this idea.

Final Answer: B

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
B

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. The intended phrasing is likely “only way,” and the general remedy for exhaustion is rest; “have rest” best matches that among the options. “Go to sleep” is specific but not the only form of rest.

Answers:
A. apply for job
B. stand in line
C. take care of proposals
D. pass course
E. play the lottery

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis of the user’s question

1) Question type
- Open-ended, goal-oriented “what would you do” scenario
- Seeks actionable strategies (procedural/decision-making)
- Hypothetical but practical planning question

2) Key entities and relationships
- Actor: “you” (general person; unspecified background)
- Goal: “be able to earn money” (enablement and action)
- Relationship: Desired outcome (income) depends on choosing viable paths (employment, self-employment, gigs, etc.), constrained by skills, time, resources, legality, and risk.

3) Constraints and hints in wording
- No explicit constraints (age, location, skills, time, capital) provided
- “Be able to” implies starting from little/no current income or capability; focus on enabling steps (skill-building, credentialing, market access) as well as immediate options
- Should include short-term and longer-term pathways
- Must be legal and ethical; avoid unsafe/illegal suggestions
- Audience/context unknown → need to propose clarifying questions or provide tiered options

Structured plan for the Solver

A) Start with brief framing
- Acknowledge broadness; state you’ll give a tiered plan: immediate, near-term, long-term.
- Emphasize legality, safety, and sustainability.

B) Clarify user context (offer concise questions)
- Location/eligibility (country, age)
- Time available per week and urgency (immediate cash vs building career)
- Skills/interests and existing assets (education, certifications, tools, car, computer)
- Constraints (childcare, disabilities, transportation)
- Income target and risk tolerance
- Access to internet/smartphone; initial capital available (if any)

C) Provide actionable paths organized by time horizon
1) Immediate/zero-to-low capital (earn within days/weeks)
- Gig platforms (delivery, rideshare if eligible, tasks, odd jobs)
- Local services (pet sitting, tutoring, cleaning, yard work, moving help)
- Online micro-work (market research, user testing, microwork)
- Selling unused items, flipping free/cheap items
- Temp agencies/day labor
- Safety and verification tips; expected pay ranges (indicative only)

2) Near-term (2–12 weeks): skill-up + entry income
- Identify in-demand, quick-to-learn skills (customer support, basic bookkeeping, data entry with quality, social media moderation, QA testing, no-code tools)
- Obtain micro-credentials/certificates; build small portfolio pieces
- Freelance marketplaces with positioning strategy, starter pricing, and reviews
- Resume/LinkedIn optimization, networking scripts, applying to part-time/remote roles

3) Long-term (3–24+ months): higher earning potential
- Formal upskilling (vocational programs, apprenticeships, degree-alternatives)
- Tech/design/trade paths, licensing where relevant
- Starting a small business (service-based, e-commerce, content/productization)
- Investing as a complement (only after emergency fund; note risks)
- Building assets: portfolio, brand, professional network

D) Decision framework to choose a path
- Match time horizon, capital, risk tolerance, and skill fit
- Consider market demand in local/online niches
- Unit economics: hourly effective rate, costs, scalability
- Diversify initially; double down on what gains traction

E) Concrete first-week action plan (template)
- Audit skills/assets; set income target and time budget
- Pick 1–2 immediate earners; set up accounts/profiles; complete verifications
- Draft simple service offers; outreach to 20–50 prospects or apply to 10–20 gigs
- Allocate daily time for applications plus 1–2 hours for skill-building
- Track efforts and iterate

F) Risks and pitfalls
- Scams and predatory “opportunities” (fees upfront, unrealistic returns)
- Misclassification/legal compliance, taxes, insurance
- Platform dependence; burnout; safety for in-person work

G) Offer to tailor
- Invite the user to provide the clarifying info for a customized plan and specific steps/platforms relevant to their location and profile.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The goal is to start earning income in a reliable, straightforward way. Among the options, applying for a job directly enables you to get employed and get paid, making it the most practical and immediate step toward earning money. Standing in line and taking care of proposals are not directly tied to earning, passing a course is indirect/long-term, and playing the lottery is unreliable.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

Question: What is a grumpy person likely to have?
Answers:
A. headache
B. understand themselves
C. compliments
D. own house
E. happiness

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Common-sense association/attribute question
- Seeks a likely possession/state linked to a descriptive trait
- Format suggests a short noun phrase answer

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: "grumpy person"
- Relationship: "likely to have" implies a characteristic, expression, or state commonly associated with being grumpy
- Target: a typical outward sign or condition (e.g., facial expression, mood, temperament)

3) Constraints and hints
- No context provided; relies on general world knowledge
- Singular, concise answer likely expected (a common collocation)
- Likely answers are brief noun phrases tied to grumpiness (e.g., facial expression like a “frown”/“scowl,” or state like a “bad mood”/“bad temper”)
- Avoid overly specific or medical interpretations; aim for widely recognized, everyday association

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
A grumpy person is commonly associated with being irritable or in a bad mood, which is more plausibly linked to having a headache than the other options. Compliments, happiness, or owning a house aren’t typically associated with grumpiness, and “understand themselves” is unrelated.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:

Question: What do drugs do?
Answers:
A. damage
B. cloud mind
C. lower i.q
D. cause illness
E. cause accidents

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis and plan for the Solver

1) Type of question
- Open-ended explanatory/definition question (“What do X do?”).
- Could be interpreted broadly; not a specific drug or class is named.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: “drugs” (ambiguous: could include medications, over-the-counter drugs, and recreational/illicit substances).
- Relationships:
  - Drugs interact with the body and brain by binding to targets (receptors, enzymes, ion channels, transporters) and altering biochemical/physiological processes.
  - Intended (therapeutic) effects vs. unintended (side) effects.
  - Short-term/acute effects vs. long-term/chronic effects.
  - Potential for tolerance, dependence, withdrawal, and addiction (for some drugs).
  - Variability based on type of drug, dose, route of administration, frequency, individual factors (age, genetics, health conditions), and interactions with other substances.

3) Constraints or hints
- The question is very general; audience and context are unspecified.
- “Respond appropriately” suggests a clear, accessible overview rather than technical depth, possibly with brief examples.
- Avoid guessing specifics; acknowledge variability across drug classes.
- Consider a brief clarification option (medications vs recreational) but provide a general answer that covers both.
- Keep it concise, include safety/harm-reduction note, and avoid personalized medical advice.

Proposed outline for the Solver
- One-sentence summary of what drugs do (alter body/brain function by interacting with biological targets).
- Distinguish categories: medications (therapeutic uses) vs recreational/illicit (psychoactive effects), noting overlap.
- Mechanisms: receptors/neurotransmitters/enzymes; examples (e.g., pain relief, reduce inflammation, change mood/awareness).
- Effects spectrum: intended benefits, side effects, risks (tolerance, dependence, addiction), short- vs long-term.
- Factors influencing effects: dose, route, frequency, individual differences, interactions.
- Brief harm-reduction/safety note and suggestion to seek professional guidance for specific drugs.

Given the broad term “drugs,” many effects vary by type and context. Among the options, “cloud mind” best captures a direct, immediate effect typical of many psychoactive drugs, whereas “damage,” “lower i.q,” “cause illness,” and “cause accidents” are potential consequences and not universal.

Final Answer: B

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
B

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Given the options, “cloud mind” best captures the immediate, core effect of many psychoactive drugs, whereas the others are potential consequences and not universal.

Question: A beaver can destroy a machines functionality if they build their dam in this?
Answers:
A. strip club
B. pocket
C. millpond
D. ontario
E. lake or river

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis Plan

1) Type of question
- Riddle/wordplay with cause-effect: asks where a beaver’s dam, if placed “in this,” would break a machine’s functionality.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entities: beaver, dam, machine, the location/context “this.”
- Relationship: Placing a beaver’s dam in a particular place or system causes a machine to stop functioning (i.e., blocks or disrupts operation).

3) Constraints and hints
- Real-world hint: Beavers build dams in rivers/streams to block water flow.
- Technical/figurative mapping: Machines rely on flows/throughputs (e.g., data stream, pipeline, memory access) that can be “blocked.”
- Possible wordplay angles:
  - “Stream” (data stream): a dam in a stream blocks flow, analogous to blocking data flow and breaking functionality.
  - “Pipeline” (CPU/software pipeline): a dam would block the pipeline.
  - “Works” (idiom: “throw a wrench in the works”): a dam in “the works” stops a mechanism.
  - “RAM” vs “dam” pun: dam in RAM could corrupt memory and halt function.
- The phrasing “in this?” implies a single-word or concise target, likely mapping beaver behavior (dams in streams) to a machine-critical flow (e.g., “stream” or “pipeline”).

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
A beaver’s dam blocks flow; a water-powered machine (a mill) relies on its pond’s flow. Building a dam in a millpond would stop the mill from working.

Final Answer: C

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
C

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. A beaver dam in a millpond would obstruct the water flow that powers a water mill, stopping the machine from functioning. Among the options, “millpond” is the most directly linked to a machine’s operation.

Question: They decided to hash things out over drinks, after enough booze they were able to get close on a few things and what?
Answers:
A. reach tentative agreement
B. suicide
C. examine thing
D. commit murder
E. stay in bed

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis Plan for Solver

1) Question type
- Open-ended sentence completion/inference
- Idiomatic/colloquial phrasing expected
- Cause-effect structure: alcohol-fueled discussion leading to some resolution

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entities: “They” (two or more people), “drinks/booze,” “a few things” (points of disagreement)
- Relationships:
  - Setting: hashing things out over drinks
  - Causal link: after enough booze → increased willingness to reconcile/compromise
  - Outcome: they “got close on a few things” and [missing parallel/concluding outcome]

3) Constraints and hints
- Informal tone suggests an idiomatic ending (e.g., “call it a night,” “agree to disagree,” “bury the hatchet,” “meet halfway,” “find common ground,” “patch things up”)
- “Got close on a few things” implies partial progress; the second clause likely names a broader resolution or pragmatic wrap-up
- Ambiguity: multiple plausible completions; no specific context about the relationship or topic
- Best approach: offer a few natural-sounding completions aligned with the tone and ask the user to choose, or clarify desired nuance (resolution vs. pause vs. partial agreement)

Potential completions for the Solver to propose (as options, not as a single guess)
- “…and agree to disagree on the rest.”
- “…and call it a night.”
- “…and bury the hatchet.”
- “…and meet halfway on the rest.”
- “…and find some common ground.”
- “…and patch things up.”
- “…and set the rest aside for another day.”

Clarifying questions the Solver could ask
- Do you want a resolution-focused ending (e.g., “bury the hatchet”) or a pragmatic wrap-up (e.g., “call it a night”)?
- Is the tone casual/light or more serious?
- Are you aiming for a common idiom or a neutral paraphrase?

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The sentence describes a conflict resolution attempt over drinks; “got close on a few things” implies partial progress leading to a provisional resolution. “Reach tentative agreement” fits this context and tone. The other options are either nonsensical or unrelated to hashing things out.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “Hash things out over drinks” leading to “got close on a few things” naturally suggests a provisional resolution; “reach tentative agreement” fits best. The other options are unrelated or inappropriate.

Question: Where could a fungus grow and not be disturbed by sunlight?
Answers:
A. under rocks
B. manhattan
C. toenails
D. grocery store
E. fallen tree

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- “Where” question seeking a location/environment. It’s a common-sense/context clue question rather than factual recall. Could be framed like a riddle or a science comprehension question.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: fungus (organism that often prefers dark, moist environments)
- Factor: sunlight (implies light exposure can disturb or inhibit growth for some fungi)
- Relationship: The location should be one where sunlight does not reach or “disturb” the fungus.

3) Constraints and hints
- The phrasing “not be disturbed by sunlight” implies:
  - A place with little to no direct sunlight.
  - Likely shaded, enclosed, underground, or otherwise dark.
  - Moisture is often implicitly favorable for fungal growth (though the question focuses specifically on absence of sunlight).

4) Expected answer form
- A location descriptor (e.g., a specific dark place) rather than a process or mechanism.
- Likely a concise, singular example.

5) Candidate location categories (for Solver to choose one concise example)
- Enclosed natural spaces: cave, inside a hollow log.
- Underground/undercover: underground, under a rock, under leaf litter, beneath tree bark.
- Man-made dark places: basement, cellar, crawl space.
- Dense cover outdoors: deep forest floor under dense canopy.

6) Ambiguities to consider
- Whether the setting should be natural vs. man-made.
- Whether moisture should be explicitly referenced or kept implicit since the question centers on sunlight.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
We need a place where sunlight doesn’t reach. Among the options, “under rocks” is a naturally dark, covered spot where sunlight won’t disturb fungal growth. The other choices are either exposed, too broad, or not reliably dark.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “Under rocks” is a reliably dark, shaded, and moist environment where sunlight won’t reach, fitting the clue best. Other options are either inconsistent in light exposure or not specific.

Question: Can you name a good reason for attending school?
Answers:
A. get smart
B. boredom
C. colds and flu
D. taking tests
E. spend time

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Open-ended, opinion/justification request (asking for a reason/benefit).

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: school (formal education setting).
- Action: attending school.
- Relationship: attending school leads to benefits (e.g., knowledge, skills, opportunities, social development).

3) Constraints and hints
- The prompt says “Respond appropriately,” implying a simple, positive, general-purpose reason is sufficient.
- Likely expects a concise, single reason (one sentence).
- Audience appears general; avoid technical jargon or controversial claims.
- Tone should be encouraging and straightforward.

4) Recommended approach for the answer
- Provide one clear, universal benefit, such as:
  - Learning essential skills (reading, writing, math, critical thinking).
  - Preparing for future opportunities (college, careers).
  - Developing social skills and teamwork.
  - Cultivating curiosity and lifelong learning habits.
- Keep it to one sentence or a short, friendly phrase.

5) Suggested answer templates (pick one)
- “To learn essential skills like reading, math, and critical thinking that you’ll use throughout life.”
- “Because it opens doors to future opportunities in college and careers.”
- “To build social skills and learn how to work with others.”
- “To discover new interests and develop a habit of lifelong learning.”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
A good reason to attend school is to gain knowledge and skills; among the options, “get smart” best matches this positive benefit.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:

Question: What state south of Kentucky and north of Alabama will you find people playing the fiddle?
Answers:
A. alabama
B. tennessee
C. violin case
D. music store
E. bow and strings

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Geographic identification with a cultural clue (riddle-style). It asks for the name of a U.S. state based on relative location and an associated activity.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entities: Kentucky, Alabama, an unnamed U.S. state, people playing the fiddle.
- Spatial relationships:
  - The target state is south of Kentucky.
  - The target state is north of Alabama.
  - Implies the state lies directly between Kentucky and Alabama (shares borders accordingly).
- Cultural clue: “people playing the fiddle” suggests associations with country/bluegrass/Appalachian music traditions.

3) Constraints and hints
- Must be a U.S. state fitting the exact north-south adjacency between Kentucky and Alabama.
- There is effectively one state that meets the geographic constraint.
- The cultural hint aligns with that state’s well-known music scene/traditions.

Expected output
- Provide the name of the state that lies south of Kentucky and north of Alabama, consistent with the fiddle-playing clue.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question asks for the U.S. state that lies south of Kentucky and north of Alabama, implying the state directly between them. The only state that meets this geographic condition is Tennessee, which also aligns with the fiddle-playing cultural hint.

Final Answer: B

Question: Though she made the cut years ago, its figurative scars would never what?
Answers:
A. joining
B. put together
C. stitch
D. heal
E. paste

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Type of question:
- Fill-in-the-blank/idiomatic completion. The prompt sets up a sentence that relies on common collocations and metaphorical language.

2) Key entities and relationships:
- Entities: 
  - “she” (subject)
  - “the cut” (metaphorical achievement/selection; also punning with a literal “cut”)
  - “figurative scars” (metaphorical aftermath/effects)
- Relationships:
  - Temporal: “years ago” indicates the event is in the past.
  - Causal/Result: Making “the cut” (idiom for being selected) is being reframed as a literal “cut,” leading to “figurative scars.”
  - The query asks for a verb describing what figurative scars “would never” do.

3) Constraints/Hints:
- The phrase “figurative scars” suggests a common collocation: scars typically “fade” over time; wounds “heal,” but scars are said to “fade.” 
- The use of “never” implies selecting a verb that is expected but negated: a standard phrase is “scars fade,” so “would never fade” fits idiomatically better than “heal” (since scars aren’t usually said to heal).
- The pun on “made the cut” strengthens the “scar” metaphor but keeps the completion idiomatic.

Guidance for Solver:
- Choose the verb that commonly collocates with “scars” in a metaphorical sense: “fade.” 
- Final completion should be: “…would never fade.”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The Planner notes that the most idiomatic completion would be “fade,” since scars typically “fade” rather than “heal.” Since “fade” is not among the options, the closest appropriate verb is “heal.” Therefore, “…its figurative scars would never heal.”

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. While “scars” typically “fade,” among the given options only “heal” fits idiomatically and grammatically; the others are awkward or incorrect in this context. “Scars would never heal” is a common metaphorical expression.

Question: What does sex often make happen in people?
Answers:
A. making love
B. feel good
C. happyness
D. wonderful thing
E. cloud judgment

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Cause-effect/general knowledge: asks what outcome sex often causes in people.
- Likely expects a concise, single-term outcome.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Cause: sex (sexual intercourse)
- Effect: an outcome that “happens in people”
- Modifier: “often” implies a common/typical consequence, not guaranteed.

3) Constraints and hints
- Wording “make happen in people” fits physiological/reproductive states rather than objects; suggests a condition that occurs within a person.
- Common, educational phrasing: “Sex often makes people X.”
- Most plausible target in simple QA datasets: “pregnancy” (or “getting pregnant”). It is something that happens in people and is a common, taught consequence of sex.
- Alternatives:
  - “orgasm” (common but not universal; phrasing “in people” fits, but educational datasets less likely)
  - “STIs” (possible, but “often” is too strong)
  - “babies” (colloquial “sex makes babies,” but “babies happen in people” is less natural than “pregnancy happens in people”)

4) Expected answer format
- Short, likely a single noun: “pregnancy”
- Acceptable variants: “getting pregnant,” “pregnancy in people,” or “pregnant.”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The planner’s likely target outcome (“pregnancy”) isn’t among the choices. Of the given options, the most common effect sex often causes in people is that it makes them feel good, which fits the “often” qualifier better than the others.

Final Answer: B

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
B

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Among the given options, “feel good” is the most plausible common effect sex often has on people. The other choices are either tautological, misspelled, vague, or less commonly “often.”

Question: Where would you see people in uniform playing with a ball?
Answers:
A. hole
B. television
C. sporting goods store
D. pool table
E. sporting event

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Common-sense/location identification question
- Seeks a typical venue/place given an activity and description
- Likely expects a concise noun phrase as the answer

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entities: "people in uniform" (teams/organized players), "playing with a ball" (ball sport)
- Relationship: Organized team sport activity implies standard sports venues

3) Constraints and hints
- Prompt asks “Where” → answer should be a place/venue
- No specific sport named → choose a general or broadly applicable venue
- “Uniform” suggests formal/organized settings (teams), not casual play
- Appropriate generic locations include: sports field, stadium, ball field, court, gymnasium
- Aim for a common, general term that covers multiple ball sports (e.g., “sports field” or “stadium”), keeping the answer brief and singular

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
“People in uniform playing with a ball” implies organized team sports. The most fitting venue among the options is a sporting event.

Final Answer: E

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
E

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “People in uniform playing with a ball” most naturally refers to organized teams, and the most appropriate location among the options is a sporting event. Other choices either aren’t venues for play (sporting goods store), are too specific or unlikely (pool table, hole), or are a medium rather than a place (television).

Question: What kind of place could have a seafood restaurant?
Answers:
A. new york
B. coastal cities
C. city
D. coastal cities
E. boston

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver:

1) Question type:
- Open-ended commonsense/location-category question (asking for a suitable type of place)
- Seeks a general category rather than a specific named location

2) Key entities and relationships:
- Entity: “seafood restaurant”
- Relationship: Typical/likely location where such a restaurant would be found (place that hosts or contains it)

3) Constraints or hints:
- Phrase “what kind of place” suggests a broad, generic type (e.g., coastal area) rather than a specific city or address
- Implies common-sense association with access to fresh seafood

4) Expected answer characteristics:
- A short, general place type (likely one or two words)
- Examples that fit: coastal area, beach, harbor, seaside town, port city, fishing village, waterfront

5) Ambiguities/considerations:
- Could also be indoors (e.g., mall, food court), but typical/common-sense strongest association is near the sea
- Aim for the most prototypical setting

6) Recommendation to Solver:
- Provide a concise, generic, high-probability location type, favoring coastal/seaside contexts (e.g., “a coastal town” or “the beach”).

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question seeks a general type of place where seafood restaurants are commonly found. The Planner recommends a broad, coastal/seaside category rather than specific cities. Among the options, “coastal cities” is the appropriate general category and matches this criterion.

Final Answer: B

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
B

CRITIC REASONING:

Question: Who was the head of the branch yelling at?
Answers:
A. owner
B. foot
C. subordinate
D. base
E. point

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Type of question:
- Wh-question seeking a specific entity (the target of an action)
- Relationship-identification: subject (head of the branch) performing an action (yelling) toward an object (who)

Key entities and relationships:
- Subject: “the head of the branch” (likely equivalent to branch head/branch manager)
- Action: “yelling” (could appear as yelled, shouting, berating, scolding)
- Object/Target: the person or group being yelled at (answer needed)

Constraints and hints:
- Answer should be a person or group (e.g., a named individual, “me,” “the employees,” “a customer”).
- Likely found via a direct construction “yell(ed) at [X]” or synonyms (“shouted at,” “berated,” “scolded”).
- If pronouns are used, resolve antecedents from nearby context.
- If multiple candidates are present, choose the direct target of the yelling (object of the preposition “at”).
- Keep the answer concise (a short noun phrase or name) without extra explanation.

What the Solver should do:
1. Locate mentions of “head of the branch” (or paraphrases like “branch manager/head”).
2. Identify the sentence describing the yelling action.
3. Extract the direct object of “yell at” (or its synonyms).
4. Resolve any pronouns to the correct referent using nearby context.
5. Provide the minimal noun phrase/name as the answer.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Given "the head of the branch" is a manager-like role, the likely target of their yelling is someone under their authority. Among the options, "subordinate" is the appropriate object of the action "yelling at." 

Final Answer: C

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
C

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Without specific context, the most plausible target for a branch head’s yelling is a subordinate; the other options are not typical targets for being yelled at.

Question: He made another call, he did this all day hoping people would what well to his offer?
Answers:
A. hang up
B. respond
C. contact
D. answer
E. attracting ducks

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver:

1) Question type
- Fill-in-the-blank / vocabulary-collocation completion.
- The prompt asks for a single verb that fits grammatically and idiomatically.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Subject: “He” (the caller).
- Object/audience: “people” (call recipients).
- Object of hope: “his offer.”
- Action context: He made calls all day with the aim of eliciting a favorable reaction to his offer.

3) Constraints and hints
- Structure: “hoping people would ____ well to his offer”
- The verb must:
  - Work with the adverb “well”
  - Typically take the preposition “to” in this construction
  - Fit a business/sales context (offers via phone calls)
  - Be in base form after “would”
- Natural collocations to consider:
  - “respond well to [an offer]” (very common/business-appropriate)
  - “react well to [an offer]” (also acceptable)
  - Less natural here: “reply well to,” “agree well to” (unnatural), “take well to [his offer]” (possible but slightly different nuance and two-word verb).
- Expected answer form: a single, common verb that collocates with “well … to” and suits the sales/offer context.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The sentence structure “hoping people would ____ well to his offer” calls for a verb that naturally pairs with “well” and takes “to.” “Respond well to” is a common collocation in this context, fitting a sales/offer scenario. Other options don’t fit the “well to” construction.

Final Answer: B

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
B

CRITIC REASONING:

Question: She needs to visit a bookshop after buying the latest fashion, where should she look?
Answers:
A. student union
B. mall
C. department store
D. library
E. town or city

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis plan for the Solver

1) Type of question
- Riddle/wordplay with an idiom or double meaning.
- Likely a “where should she look?” punchline based on a phrase tied to “latest fashion.”

2) Key entities and relationships
- She: a shopper.
- Latest fashion: could map to idioms/synonyms like “in,” “in style,” “in vogue,” “trend,” “mode.”
- Bookshop: evokes “books,” “novel,” “volume,” “store,” “shop.”
- Relationship: Sequence implied (“after buying the latest fashion”) leading to a location to look for a bookshop. The riddle suggests the answer is a phrase combining fashion-term + location indicator.

3) Constraints/hints in wording
- “Latest fashion” is a clue phrase; common idioms include “in fashion,” “in style,” “in vogue.”
- “Where should she look?” implies a prepositional answer using the fashion idiom, e.g., “in Vogue” (name of a fashion magazine and a literal preposition + noun), or “in style.”
- Possible pun link: “novel” = a book; “novel” also means new/latest, but the phrasing points more strongly to “in vogue.”
- Expect a concise, clever location-style answer rather than a literal place like “the mall directory.”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The clue hints at a place where she can buy the latest fashion and then visit a bookshop in the same trip. Among the options, a mall commonly has both clothing stores and a bookshop.

Final Answer: B

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------

Question: Where could you see an advertisement while reading news?
Answers:
A. television

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Question type:
- Common-sense/location question asking for a place/context
- Likely expects a short noun phrase (e.g., a medium or location)

2) Key entities and relationships:
- Entity: advertisement (ad)
- Action/context: reading news
- Relationship: Where an ad would typically be seen in the context of consuming news content

3) Constraints/hints:
- “Where could you see” implies a location or medium rather than an action
- “While reading news” narrows to news mediums where ads are commonly present
- Likely everyday contexts: print (newspaper), digital (news website/app), within/on a page (sidebar, banner)
- Expected concise answer; probably a common medium like “newspaper” or “news website”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question asks where one might see ads specifically in the context of “reading news.” Among the options, the medium that aligns with reading news and commonly displays ads is a web page (e.g., a news website page). Other choices like television imply watching, not reading.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “While reading news” implies a reading medium; a news web page commonly displays ads, unlike TV or a bus. Email is possible but less directly tied to reading news broadly. Thus, D fits best.

Question: What is required to be good at playing tennis?
Answers:
A. tennis racket
B. skill
C. competition
D. tennis court
E. legs

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Open-ended, descriptive/explanatory
- Seeks factors/requirements (conditions/skills) rather than a single fact
- Implicit cause-effect: which inputs lead to being good at tennis

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: Tennis performance (“being good at playing tennis”)
- Related domains and their roles:
  - Technical skills: strokes (forehand, backhand, serve, volley), footwork, consistency
  - Physical attributes: endurance, agility, speed, strength, flexibility
  - Tactical/strategic understanding: shot selection, positioning, patterns, opponent analysis
  - Mental skills: focus, resilience, confidence, composure, decision-making
  - Practice/training: deliberate practice, repetition, drills, match play, feedback/coaching
  - Knowledge: rules, scoring, etiquette
  - Equipment: appropriate racquet, strings, shoes; injury prevention
  - Lifestyle/recovery: nutrition, sleep, warm-up/cool-down, injury management
- Relationship: These factors contribute to or are required for achieving proficiency

3) Constraints/hints
- “Required” suggests distinguishing essentials vs helpful enhancements
- General audience; no level specified, so outline core essentials and advanced optimizers
- No numerical data requested; a concise structured list with brief explanations fits
- Consider accessibility/variability (age/fitness levels) but keep focus on common requirements
- Avoid giving a single prescriptive path; present categories with examples and prioritize fundamentals over nice-to-haves

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question asks what is required to be good at playing tennis. Among the choices, skill directly captures the core requirement for proficiency—encompassing technical, physical, tactical, and mental abilities. Equipment (racket), location (court), body parts (legs), or competition are not, by themselves, sufficient to make someone good.

Final Answer: B

SOLVER ANSWER:

Question: What state is the John Davis  Lodge toll road found in?
Answers:
A. new jersey
B. eastern united states
C. good repair
D. connecticut
E. arizona

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis:

1) Question type:
- Simple factual lookup (identification): asks for the U.S. state in which a specific toll road is located.

2) Key entities and relationships:
- Entity: “John Davis Lodge” toll road (also known as the John Davis Lodge Turnpike/Connecticut Turnpike).
- Relationship: Geographic location — the U.S. state where this toll road is found.

3) Constraints and hints:
- The toll road is named after John Davis Lodge (a former governor), suggesting it may be an officially designated name for a well-known turnpike.
- The phrasing “found in” implies a single U.S. state.
- Task requires pinpointing the state, not the specific highways or segments.
- Ensure verification that “John Davis Lodge” is the formal/ceremonial name of a toll road and identify its state via reliable sources (e.g., state DOT or Wikipedia entry on the turnpike).

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The “John Davis Lodge” toll road is the formal name for the Connecticut Turnpike, so it is located in the state of Connecticut.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. The John Davis Lodge Turnpike is the formal name for the Connecticut Turnpike, located in Connecticut and named after former Connecticut governor John Davis Lodge.

C. surprise
D. spoons
E. party

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis:

1) Type of question:
- Fill-in-the-blank/completion question relying on commonsense and idiomatic knowledge.

2) Key entities and relationships:
- Entity: “The man”
- Entity: “clown college”
- Target missing noun phrase after “run away with the …”
- Relationship: Motivation or goal — he went to clown college because he had always wanted to “run away with” something.
- Contextual association: Clown college is strongly associated with the circus.

3) Constraints/Hints:
- Phrase “run away with the …” is a common idiom completed as a specific organization.
- Clown college implies training for performers typical of that organization.
- The definite article “the” suggests a well-known, singular concept in this idiom.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The phrase “run away with the …” is a common idiom typically completed as “circus,” and clown college is strongly associated with the circus. Therefore, the man wanted to run away with the circus.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:

Question: Jamie wanted to reduce her waist size, but all of her efforts failed miserably.  She continued to do what?
Answers:
A. gain weight
B. augment
C. dispare
D. make larger
E. expand

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Common-sense inference / cause-effect in a short narrative.
- Seeks the likely consequence when attempts to reduce waist size fail.
- Format: “She continued to do what?” expects a verb phrase describing an ongoing outcome.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: Jamie (subject).
- Goal: reduce her waist size.
- Action: made efforts toward that goal.
- Outcome: efforts “failed miserably.”
- Relationship: Failure to reduce waist size implies the waist did not get smaller; “miserably” hints it may have done the opposite.

3) Constraints and hints
- Tense/aspect: “continued to” suggests an ongoing trend/action in the past.
- The antonymic consequence of failing to reduce waist size is either no change or an increase.
- “Failed miserably” strengthens the inference toward the opposite trend (increase), not merely stasis.
- Expected answer: a concise verb phrase capturing the ongoing opposite outcome, e.g., “gain weight,” “put on inches,” or “increase her waist size.”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Because her attempts to reduce waist size “failed miserably,” the opposite trend likely continued. The most natural, concise outcome is that she continued to gain weight.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Given her attempts to reduce waist size failed miserably, the most natural inference is that she kept gaining weight. Option A fits the “continued to” construction best and matches the context.

Question: James felt himself losing consciousness.  He was frightened.  He didn't want this.  He was scared of what?
Answers:
A. death
B. coma
C. peace
D. forgetfulness
E. loss of life

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Type of question:
- Implicit inference/reading comprehension. The question asks for the implied object of fear based on context, not explicitly stated.

Key entities and relationships:
- Entity: James
- State: Felt himself losing consciousness
- Emotion: Frightened/scared; “He didn’t want this”
- Relationship: Cause-effect between the sensation of losing consciousness and the fear; “this” likely refers to the impending loss of consciousness.

Constraints and hints:
- The text emphasizes “losing consciousness” and his resistance (“didn’t want this”), indicating the source of fear is the impending blackout/fainting.
- The question expects a concise noun phrase answering “scared of what?”

Possible interpretations to consider for the Solver:
- Scared of passing out/blackout/losing consciousness (most direct referent of “this”).
- Scared of dying (a broader fear sometimes associated with losing consciousness).
- Less likely alternatives (e.g., injury) are not supported by the text.

Expected answer form:
- A short phrase, e.g., “passing out” or “losing consciousness.”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
He was scared of losing consciousness (passing out). Among the options, “coma” is the closest match to that fear.

Final Answer: B

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
B

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I disagree with the Solver. The passage implies a fear that losing consciousness could lead to dying; “coma” is too specific and not clearly suggested. “Death” (or “loss of life”) fits better, with “death” being the more standard choice.

Question: If someone is aloof and self-important, what is their experience when meeting people?
Answers:
A. stress
B. nervousness
C. smile
D. being bored
E. making new friends

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis plan for the Solver

1) Type of question
- Concept-to-behavior inference: asks what interpersonal experience/behavior results from given personality traits.
- Likely expects a concise descriptive phrase (not a definition), akin to a cause-effect or paraphrase question.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Traits: “aloof” (distant, detached) and “self-important” (haughty, superior).
- Context: “when meeting people” (initial social interactions).
- Relationship: These traits shape how the person experiences/approaches others—likely distant, dismissive, superior stance.

3) Constraints and hints
- Tone is negative; expects social demeanor description.
- Likely a short, idiomatic or plain-English phrase describing first-encounter behavior (e.g., standoffish, distant, looking down on others, keeping people at arm’s length).
- Avoid over-explanation; produce a succinct characterization of the experience/approach to others.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Given the traits "aloof" (distant, detached) and "self-important" (haughty), when meeting people such a person would likely appear uninterested or dismissive rather than friendly or anxious. Among the options, "being bored" best matches this demeanor.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. "Aloof" and "self-important" suggest a detached, superior attitude; such a person is likely to feel or project boredom when meeting others rather than anxiety, friendliness, or eagerness to connect. Thus "being bored" best fits.

Question: He was receiving workman's compensation, he had tripped over a metal rod while building where?
Answers:
A. factory
B. construction site
C. engine
D. insides of skyscraper's walls
E. shops

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver:

1) Question Type
- Specific detail/location retrieval (where-question) based on a narrative/context.
- Cause-effect is implied (injury → workman’s compensation), but the query asks for the location tied to the action “building.”

2) Key Entities and Relationships
- Entity: “he” (a male subject previously mentioned in the passage)
- Event: “tripped over a metal rod”
- Activity: “while building”
- Outcome: “was receiving workman’s compensation”
- Relationship: He tripped over a metal rod during the act of building something at a specific place; this led to him receiving workman’s compensation.

3) Constraints/Hints
- The answer must be a location (where he was building when the trip occurred).
- Likely a concise phrase (e.g., “at the [location]” or “in the [place]”).
- Must be directly supported by the source text; do not infer beyond the passage.
- Use the antecedent of “he” from context to ensure the correct incident is referenced if multiple injuries are mentioned.

Expected Answer Format
- A short location phrase, e.g., “at/in [location].”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question asks for the location where he was building when he tripped over a metal rod, leading to workman’s compensation. Among the options, “construction site” directly matches the context of “building” and fits the described incident.

Final Answer: B

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
B

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “Tripped over a metal rod while building” most plausibly refers to a construction site, aligning with work-related injury and workers’ compensation context.

Question: John and James spent most of their time communicating with each other on their project.  The time required to communicate slowed their what?
Answers:
A. static
B. train of thought.
C. progress
D. transfer of information
E. collaboration

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Question type:
- Cause-effect inference; essentially a fill-in-the-blank seeking the most plausible noun phrase completing “slowed their ____.”

2) Key entities and relationships:
- Entities: John, James, their project, time required to communicate.
- Relationship: The overhead/time spent on communication caused a slowing of something related to their work on the project.

3) Constraints and hints:
- The phrasing “slowed their what?” implies a common collocation.
- In project/work contexts, “slowed their progress” is a frequent and natural phrase.
- Alternatives could include “productivity,” “pace,” or “work,” but “progress” most directly fits the idiom “slowed their progress” and aligns with project advancement.

Guidance for Solver:
- Choose the most conventional, concise completion: “progress.”
- Ensure the answer is a single noun fitting “slowed their ___” and consistent with project context.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The sentence implies a typical work context where spending excessive time on communication reduces the pace of advancing the project. The common collocation is “slowed their progress,” which best fits the context.

Final Answer: C

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
C

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “Slowed their progress” is the most natural and context-appropriate phrase; the other options don’t fit as well with “slowed their ___” in a project context.

Question: When you play around with your dog they will have?
Answers:
A. alive
B. health
C. fun
D. playing dead
E. black

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Fill-in-the-blank / causal consequence
- Seeks a short, common-sense completion describing the likely outcome of an action

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entities: "you" (the person), "your dog" (the pet)
- Action: "play around with" (engaging in playful interaction)
- Relationship: Cause-effect — playing with a dog leads to a positive state or experience for the dog

3) Constraints and hints
- Informal phrasing; expects a simple, everyday term
- Pronoun "they" refers to the dog; grammatical completion should fit “they will have ___”
- Likely a single noun or concise noun phrase
- Context suggests a positive outcome associated with play

4) Likely answer form
- Primary: a positive experience/emotion noun (e.g., “fun,” “a good time”)
- Secondary plausible outcomes: “exercise,” “joy,” “energy release,” but less likely than “fun”

5) Expected final answer style
- Very short completion, e.g., “fun” or “a good time”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question asks for a common-sense outcome of playing with a dog. The phrase “they will have ___” best fits a positive experience resulting from play. Among the choices, “fun” is the concise, everyday term that matches this causal relationship and grammatical structure. Other options are either ungrammatical or not directly implied by playing.

Final Answer: C

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
C

CRITIC REASONING:

I agree with the Solver. Playing with a dog naturally leads to them having fun, and "fun" fits the grammar and context best among the choices.

Question: Where would a person keep a book while it's being read?
Answers:
A. closet
B. library of congress
C. classroom
D. in bed
E. desk

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
- Question type: Common-sense location question (where-object-is-during-action)
- Key entities:
  - Person (agent performing the reading)
  - Book (object)
- Relationship: The typical physical location or support of the book during the action of reading.
- Constraints/hints:
  - “While it’s being read” implies an active reading posture, immediate access/handling.
  - Suggests a position that allows viewing and turning pages.
- Likely context-specific locations to consider:
  - In the person’s hands (most direct, active reading)
  - On their lap (seated, casual reading)
  - On a table/desk (supported surface for reading)

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question asks for a typical surface or position that supports a book during active reading. From the likely contexts (hands, lap, or a table/desk), the best match among the options is a desk, which supports the book for easy viewing and page turning.

Final Answer: E

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
E

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “While it’s being read” implies an active reading surface or support; among the options, a desk is the most appropriate.

Question: The student needed to  get some new pencils, where did he go?
Answers:
A. store
B. classroom
C. backpack
D. cabinet
E. teacher

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver:

1) Question type
- Commonsense reasoning / goal-oriented “where” question (inferring a likely destination based on a need/action).

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: “the student” (he)
- Object/need: “new pencils” (implies purchasing, not borrowing or sharpening)
- Relationship: To obtain new pencils, one typically goes to a retail location that sells school supplies.

3) Constraints and hints
- “New” signals buying rather than borrowing or sharpening.
- No specific brand or special type; general school supplies.
- The subject is a student, suggesting typical school-supply sources.

4) Plausible answer space (ranked by typicality/generalization)
- “Store” (most generic, commonly accepted in such questions)
- “Stationery store” / “school supply store”
- “Office supply store”
- “Bookstore” (often sells school supplies)
- “Supermarket” / “convenience store” (less specific but possible)

5) Exclusions
- Library, classroom, or teacher’s desk are unlikely since “new” implies purchase, not borrowing.

6) Expected answer form
- A concise place noun (likely singular), e.g., “the store” or “a stationery store.”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Reasoning:
- The need is “new pencils,” which implies purchasing rather than borrowing.
- The most typical place to buy school supplies in general is a store.
- Options like classroom, backpack, cabinet, or teacher suggest borrowing or retrieving, not buying.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

Question: She loved buying products, she was driven by her what to shop more than any practical needs?
Answers:
A. desire
B. money
C. time
D. credit
E. spending money

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Fill-in-the-blank/cloze sentence focused on vocabulary/word choice.
- Seeks a noun that explains the motivation behind shopping behavior.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: “She” (a person who loves buying products).
- Action: Shopping/buying products.
- Cause/motivation: Driven by an internal factor rather than practical needs.
- Relationship: Internal motive > practical necessity.

3) Constraints and hints
- The phrase structure “driven by her ____ to shop” suggests a noun that naturally takes an infinitive complement (“to shop”).
- Suitable collocations: “desire to shop,” “urge to shop,” “compulsion to shop.”
- The contrast with “practical needs” implies an emotional/psychological drive, not necessity.
- “Impulse(s)” usually fits as “driven by her impulses” (without “to shop”), whereas “desire/urge/compulsion” fits with “to shop.”
- Register likely general/basic vocabulary; “desire” and “urge” are more common/neutral; “compulsion” implies a stronger, possibly clinical connotation.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The sentence contrasts an emotional/psychological motivation with practical needs. The phrase “driven by her ___ to shop” naturally fits “desire,” as in “driven by her desire to shop.” Other options (money, time, credit, spending money) don’t fit the collocation or the intended meaning.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:

I agree with the Solver. The sentence contrasts emotional motivation with practical needs, and “desire to shop” is the natural, idiomatic fit. The other options don’t collocate with “to shop” in this way.

Question: How does getting paid feel?
Answers:
A. income tax
B. satisfaction
C. sorrow
D. ocean
E. bill collectors to happy

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Question type
- Open-ended, subjective/experiential description (“How does it feel?”)
- Seeks affective/emotional and possibly sensory/metaphoric framing rather than factual data
- Could be answered generally, then tailored with factors that modulate the feeling

Key entities and relationships
- Entity: “getting paid” = receiving compensation (paycheck, deposit, cash, commission, bonus)
- Outcome: emotional/psychological states (relief, security, validation, pride, excitement, motivation; also anxiety, disappointment, pressure)
- Modulating factors:
  - Context: first paycheck vs routine pay vs overdue pay; bonus vs underpayment
  - Financial situation: stability vs paycheck-to-paycheck stress; debt obligations
  - Effort/achievement: after hard work, risky project, creative work
  - Predictability/amount: size vs expectations; regular salary vs variable gig/commission
  - Logistics: deductions/taxes visible; timing of bills; late/early deposits
  - Cultural/personal values about money and work

Constraints or hints
- No explicit constraints; user intent likely conversational and empathetic
- Keep it concise, relatable, and human-centered; avoid jargon
- Bulleted list or a brief evocative paragraph plus bullets works well
- Consider acknowledging both positive and mixed emotions
- Optionally invite the user to share context to personalize (e.g., first job? freelance? tight month?)

Proposed answer structure for Solver
1) One or two-sentence evocative summary (e.g., “Like a breath you didn’t know you were holding finally letting go…”)
2) Bulleted list of common positive feelings (relief/security, validation/pride, freedom/possibility, motivation)
3) Bulleted list of common mixed/negative feelings (pressure to budget, disappointment after deductions, anxiety about stability, guilt/imposter concerns)
4) Factors that make it feel different (timing, amount vs expectation, form of payment, financial obligations)
5) Brief, friendly follow-up question to tailor further (“Is this about your first paycheck, a bonus, or getting paid irregularly?”)

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question asks for the emotional feeling associated with “getting paid.” Among the choices, “satisfaction” best matches the typical positive, validating feeling people experience when receiving compensation. The other options are not feelings (income tax, ocean), are typically negative (sorrow), or are awkward/irrelevant (“bill collectors to happy”).

Final Answer: B

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
B

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “Satisfaction” is the only option that sensibly describes how getting paid feels; the others are either not feelings, negative/unrelated, or nonsensical.

Question: The fat man refused to accept what was possible, he complained that he what the simplest activities?
Answers:
A. no go
B. unlikely
C. unable
D. cant do
E. impossibility

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Question type
- Fill-in-the-blank / sentence completion (focused on correct verb phrase and tense)
- Also tests grammar and modality (expressing inability) in reported speech

2) Key entities and relationships
- Subject: “the fat man”
- Actions:
  - Refused to accept what was possible (denial of realistic limits)
  - Complained (reported speech follows)
- Reported content: “he [verb phrase] the simplest activities”
  - Relationship: his complaint concerns his ability/inability to perform very simple activities

3) Constraints and hints
- Tense is past: “refused,” “complained,” so the reported clause should align with past-time reference
- Semantics suggest inability or difficulty (complaining about simplest activities implies “couldn’t do,” “was unable to do,” “found it hard to do”)
- Likely needs a modal or periphrastic form indicating inability (e.g., “couldn’t,” “was unable to”) plus a verb like “do/perform”
- Optional emphasis marker like “even” fits the pragmatic cue (“the simplest activities”)
- The sentence ends with a question mark, but structurally it reads as a statement; the exercise likely ignores punctuation or expects a declarative completion despite the question mark

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The clause after “complained that he … the simplest activities” needs to express inability in reported speech, ideally “was unable to (do).” Among the options, “unable” is the only one that fits that meaning; others are ungrammatical or wrong in form (“cant do” is present and malformed; “no go,” “unlikely,” “impossibility” don’t fit syntactically). Although “was unable to do” would be ideal, “unable” is the closest correct choice provided.

Final Answer: C

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
C

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. The sentence requires an expression of inability, and among the options only "unable" fits semantically and syntactically (as in "was unable to [do] the simplest activities"), despite the ellipsis.

Question: Where can meat last a long time?
Answers:
A. backery
B. ham sandwich
C. fridge
D. butcher shop
E. freezer

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver:

1) Question type
- WH-location question (“Where…?”) seeking a place/location.
- Simple common-sense/factual query.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: “meat” (perishable food).
- Relationship: Conditions under which meat’s shelf life is extended (“last a long time”).
- Location focus: A place where meat is stored to maximize longevity.

3) Constraints and hints
- “Where” implies a physical storage place rather than a process.
- “Last a long time” suggests significantly extended preservation, pointing to very cold storage rather than room temp or standard refrigeration.
- Likely everyday household context; concise answer expected.

4) Ambiguities to resolve
- Refrigerator vs freezer: “a long time” strongly favors “freezer” (or “deep freeze”), not just “fridge.”
- Industrial alternatives (e.g., vacuum-sealed frozen storage) exist but the question seems general.

5) Recommended answer format
- Short, direct location phrase (e.g., “In the freezer.”)
- Optionally acceptable variant: “In a deep freezer.”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question asks for a location where meat can last a long time. Among the options, “freezer” best fits because very cold storage extends shelf life far more than a fridge or other places listed.

Final Answer: E

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
E

CRITIC REASONING:

I agree with the Solver. Meat lasts the longest when frozen; a freezer preserves it far longer than a fridge, butcher shop, bakery, or a sandwich.

Question: What group of musicians will include someone playing the cello?
Answers:
A. ocean
B. symphony
C. band
D. music store
E. music shop

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Identification/definition: asks for the specific type of musical ensemble that, by definition, includes a cellist.
- Not multiple-choice; expects a concise noun phrase.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: group of musicians (ensemble).
- Instrument: cello.
- Relationship: the ensemble’s standard instrumentation necessarily includes a cello player.

3) Constraints and hints
- “Will include” implies guaranteed inclusion by standard instrumentation, not merely possible.
- Singular, likely expects a common, specific ensemble name rather than a broad category.

4) Candidate ensembles that inherently include a cello
- String quartet (2 violins, viola, cello) — canonical and widely recognized.
- Piano trio (piano, violin, cello).
- String trio (violin, viola, cello).
- Piano quartet (piano, violin, viola, cello).
- Piano quintet (piano + string quartet).
- String quintet (varies, but standard forms still include a cello).

5) Strategy for final answer
- Prefer the most common, succinct, unambiguous ensemble known to universally include a cello.
- Avoid broad groups like “orchestra” or “band,” which are not guaranteed in all contexts.
- The safest, most prototypical single answer: “string quartet.”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
We need an ensemble that, by standard instrumentation, includes a cellist. Among the options, “symphony” (understood as a symphony orchestra) includes a cello section by definition, whereas a band does not necessarily include cellos, and the other choices aren’t ensembles.

Final Answer: B

SOLVER ANSWER:

1) Question type:
- WH-question asking for a location (“Where…”). Likely a concise noun phrase answer.
- Could be an image-based/visual question (common in VQA datasets) referencing visible elements.

2) Key entities and relationships:
- Entities: bees; red flowers.
- Relationship: bees “congregate” (gather/cluster) in/at/on/around a place associated with the red flowers.
- Target: the specific place/setting where the bees are gathering (e.g., on a plant, in a garden, on a bush, in a field, etc.).

3) Constraints/Hints:
- The phrase “with red flowerS” suggests the flowers are red and plural; the location should be tied to those flowers.
- Expected answer format is likely short (one to a few words), e.g., “in the garden,” “on the bush,” “on the plant,” “in the field.”
- No additional context provided; if this is from an image, the exact location must be derived from that image.

Information needed / Clarification:
- If this refers to a specific image, the image is needed to identify the exact location.
- If textual context exists (e.g., a sentence or caption), provide it to pinpoint the location.

Recommendation for Solver:
- Look for a visible setting or surface associated with the red flowers (e.g., flower bush, plant, tree, garden bed).
- Answer with a concise location phrase tied to the flowers (e.g., “on the red flowers,” “in the garden,” depending on context).

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
We need a location associated with red flowers where bees would gather. Among the choices, a rose garden specifically features red flowers and is a natural place for bees to congregate. Other options are not suitable locations (trash can, honey) or less specific (bouquet, field).

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Among the options, “rose garden” is the most specific location strongly associated with red flowers and a natural place for bees to gather. “Field of flowers” is plausible but less specific to red flowers; the others are unsuitable.

Question: What is someone who gets angry after getting drunk likely to participate in?
Answers:
A. violence
B. falling down
C. vomiting
D. vomiting
E. lower standards

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
- Question type: Common-sense causal inference (behavior prediction)
- Key entities:
  - Subject: a person who gets angry after getting drunk
  - Context: intoxication leading to anger
  - Outcome: an activity/event they are likely to participate in
- Relationships:
  - Cause: alcohol consumption → anger
  - Effect: increased likelihood of aggressive/confrontational behavior
- Constraints/hints:
  - “Likely to participate in” implies a typical or common outcome, not guaranteed
  - Expected to be a concise event/activity (probably a short noun phrase)
- Expected answer format: A brief activity/event associated with angry drunken behavior (e.g., a type of fight or confrontation)

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Reasoning: The subject becomes angry when drunk, which commonly leads to aggressive or confrontational behavior. Among the options, “violence” best matches this likely outcome.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. If someone gets angry when drunk, they are more likely to engage in aggressive behavior; “violence” best fits “participate in” compared to options like vomiting or falling down.

Question: The teacher told all the students that listening was key, it was the main way they would gain what?
Answers:
A. empathy
B. anxiety
C. knowlege
D. falling down
E. hear things

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Commonsense/reading comprehension inference.
- Cause-effect/means-end: “Listening was key” → it’s the main way they would gain X.
- Fill-in-the-blank style for a missing noun concept.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entities: Teacher (speaker), Students (listeners).
- Action/means: Listening (described as “key,” i.e., primary/essential).
- Outcome/goal: “gain what?” (result of listening in an educational context).

3) Constraints and hints
- Educational setting implies the goal of listening is tied to learning outcomes.
- “Gain” collocates strongly with “knowledge,” “understanding,” or “information.”
- “Main way” and “key” emphasize a fundamental academic outcome.

4) Candidate answers (ranked with rationale)
- Highest likelihood: “knowledge” — canonical phrasing: listening is key to gaining knowledge.
- Strong alternative: “understanding” — also common in pedagogy: listening helps gain understanding.
- Other plausible: “information” or “learning” — acceptable but less idiomatic than “gain knowledge.”

5) Disambiguation notes
- Singular noun expected.
- No other domain-specific cues; default to standard educational phrasing.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Listening being “key” in a classroom implies it’s the primary means to acquire information/learning. Among the choices, “knowledge” best fits this educational context. The other options (empathy, anxiety, falling down, hear things) do not align with the typical outcome a teacher emphasizes.

Final Answer: C

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
C

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. In an educational context, “listening is key” most naturally implies it’s essential for gaining knowledge; the other options don’t fit the teacher’s intended outcome.

Question: Stanley had a dream that was very vivid and scary. He had trouble telling it from what?
Answers:
A. reality
B. imagination
C. dreamworker
D. nightmare
E. awake

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
- Type of question: Common-sense inference/reading comprehension (cause-effect implication).
- Key entities:
  - Stanley (person)
  - A dream (described as very vivid and scary)
- Relationships:
  - Because the dream was very vivid and scary, Stanley had difficulty distinguishing the dream (“it”) from something else in his waking experience.
- Core referent resolution:
  - “It” refers to the dream.
- Likely target concept:
  - The question implies difficulty telling the dream from real waking experience (e.g., reality/real life).
- Constraints/hints:
  - No external context provided; relies on typical idiomatic understanding that vivid dreams can be hard to distinguish from reality.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The dream being very vivid and scary suggests it felt lifelike, making it hard to distinguish from real life. Thus, he had trouble telling it from reality.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. A very vivid, scary dream can feel lifelike, making it hard to distinguish from reality. "Reality" best fits the common expression "hard to tell the dream from reality."

Question: The city's community garden was demolished for yet another what?
Answers:
A. wasteland
B. ocean
C. desert
D. parking lot
E. flowers

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Fill-in-the-blank/cloze completion.
- Framed as a rhetorical/critical statement (“yet another …”), implying a commonly criticized, repetitive type of development.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: “the city's community garden” (public/green space).
- Action/relationship: “was demolished for” → cause/purpose of demolition.
- Target/complement: “yet another [X]” → a singular, countable noun phrase describing the replacement development.

3) Constraints and hints
- “Yet another” signals something commonplace, proliferating, and often negatively viewed in urban contexts.
- Expected answer is a concise noun phrase (e.g., “parking lot,” “luxury condo,” “apartment complex,” “shopping mall,” “high-rise,” “office tower,” “Starbucks,” etc.).
- Tone suggests criticism of overdevelopment or homogenization.
- If tied to a specific text/source, the answer must match that source’s exact phrasing.
- Without context, multiple plausible completions exist; clarification or source recall is needed.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The phrase “yet another” suggests a common, often criticized urban replacement. Of the options, “parking lot” is the typical trope for demolishing green space in cities.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:

Question: WHat do cats get into when they are ripping things apart?
Answers:
A. dog's mouth
B. floor
C. garage
D. trouble
E. nature

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Question type
- Common-sense/idiomatic inference question
- Likely single-word or short noun phrase answer
- Could be framed as cause-effect (behavior → consequence/state)

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: cats
- Action: ripping things apart (destructive behavior)
- Sought outcome/state: what they “get into” as a result or during that behavior

3) Constraints/Hints
- Wording “get into” suggests an idiomatic state or consequence rather than a physical object
- Likely everyday knowledge; informal tone
- Expected concise answer (e.g., one noun phrase)

Ambiguities to consider
- Could refer to consequence: “trouble”
- Could refer to mental state: “a frenzy,” “a mood,” “a tearing mood”
- Could refer to result of action: “shreds” (they rip things to shreds)
- Could refer to target/object they access: “trash,” “garbage,” “bags”
- Without context, “trouble” is a common idiomatic fit

Output expectation for Solver
- Provide a short, generic, idiomatic answer (preferably one or two words)
- Optionally acknowledge alternates if needed, but brevity likely preferred

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The phrase “get into” here is idiomatic, implying the consequence of destructive behavior. When cats are ripping things apart, they commonly “get into trouble,” which best fits the everyday expression.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:

Question: What is a good result of losing weight?
Answers:
A. increased energy
B. healthier
C. loose skin
D. beauty
E. death

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Open-ended/benefits question asking for a positive outcome (cause-effect: losing weight -> good result).
- Likely expects a concise, general example rather than technical detail.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: losing weight (assumed intentional, healthy weight loss).
- Relationship: leads to beneficial outcomes.
- Outcome domain options: health markers (blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol), disease risk (heart disease, type 2 diabetes), functional benefits (mobility, joint pain), quality of life (energy, sleep, mood), longevity.

3) Constraints/hints
- Wording is broad and singular (“a good result”), so provide one clear, universally applicable benefit, or at most a couple of short examples.
- Keep language simple and non-technical.
- Avoid implying unhealthy weight loss; frame as healthy weight loss.
- No need for measurements or detailed medical claims; general benefit is sufficient.
- Keep response brief and direct.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
We’re looking for a positive, specific outcome of healthy weight loss. Among the options, “increased energy” is a clear, commonly experienced benefit. “Healthier” is vague; “loose skin” and “death” are negative; “beauty” is subjective.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “Increased energy” is a clear, specific positive outcome of healthy weight loss. “Healthier” is too vague, and the others are negative or subjective.

================================================================================

Question: A person lived in my what?
Answers:
A. demonstration
B. conference
C. building
D. garage
E. mouth

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Clarification/ellipsis/cloze-style question: The user is asking to identify or confirm the missing noun in the phrase “A person lived in my ___?”
- Could also be a prompt for disambiguation (the user likely heard or read something and is seeking the specific noun).

2) Key entities and relationships
- Subject: “a person”
- Possessor: “my” (the speaker’s possession)
- Relationship: habitation/residence (“lived in”)
- Target noun: a place/container/body-part/abstract space owned by the speaker where living could be literal or figurative.

3) Constraints and hints
- Extremely limited context; no prior text to anchor the noun.
- The phrasing suggests surprise or incredulity.
- Possessive “my” implies the location is personally owned or part of the speaker (e.g., home, room, car, head/mind, heart).
- Could be literal (home, apartment, basement, attic, car) or figurative/idiomatic (head/mind, heart, dreams). Could also be cultural/idiomatic (e.g., “There was an old woman who lived in a shoe,” though that is not “my shoe”).
- No time frame, region, or genre provided (could be a quote, riddle, transcript, or misheard line).

4) Ambiguities to resolve
- Is the user quoting something specific (movie/book/news), or asking for suggestions?
- Is the context literal or figurative?
- What is the domain (everyday event, legal/tenant issue, medical/metaphorical, joke/riddle)?
- Any preceding sentence that mentions the noun?
- Geographic/cultural context that might hint typical phrases.

5) Information needed from user
- Provide the surrounding sentence or source of the quote.
- Clarify if they want literal places or figurative expressions.
- Indicate whether they’re recalling a known phrase/idiom, a riddle, or an actual situation.
- Any clues: who said it, when, where, and what was being discussed.

6) Possible categories to consider (not answers, just classes)
- Literal personal property/space: house, apartment, room, basement, attic, garage, car.
- Body/abstract: head/mind, heart, dreams, imagination.
- Unusual/novelty: shoe, closet, mailbox, computer/account.
- Legal/social: rental unit, sublet, storage unit.

7) Recommended next step for Solver
- Ask concise clarifying questions to get context:
  - Can you share the full sentence or where you heard this?
  - Do you mean a literal place you own, or a figurative expression?
  - Is this from a quote, riddle, or a real-life situation?
- If the user can’t provide context, offer a brief list of common literal and figurative completions and ask them to pick which fits.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
We’re looking for a plausible location someone could live that fits naturally with the possessive “my.” Among the options, “demonstration,” “conference,” and “mouth” don’t make sense as residences. “Garage” is possible but unusual. “Building” is a common, natural fit: “A person lived in my building.”

Final Answer: C

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
C

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Among the options, “building” fits the common, natural phrasing “someone lived in my building.” “Garage” is possible but less typical; the others don’t make sense as residences.

Question: The skin was cut while chopping onions, where was this skin likely cut?
Answers:
A. good health
B. finger
C. meat
D. body
E. own family

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Question type:
- Commonsense inference (likely location/body part) based on an activity scenario.

Key entities and relationships:
- Activity: chopping onions (using a knife in the kitchen).
- Event: skin was cut.
- Relationship: Chopping with a knife commonly leads to accidental cuts on the body part holding the food.

Constraints/hints:
- “Where was this skin likely cut?” asks for the most probable body part.
- Typical outcome of chopping-related accidents points to the fingers (or hand), especially the fingertips.

Expected answer focus:
- A concise body part, most likely “finger” (acceptably “hand/finger,” with “finger” being the most specific).

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Reasoning:
When chopping onions with a knife, accidental cuts most commonly occur on the body part holding the food—the fingers. Therefore, the skin likely cut was on a finger.

Final Answer: B

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
B

CRITIC REASONING:

Question: What might you feel after doing housework for hours?
Answers:
A. anger
B. not boredom
C. stress
D. boredom
E. anxiety

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver:

1) Question type:
- Common-sense, cause-effect question expecting a short, likely single-word answer.

2) Key entities and relationships:
- Entity: “you” (generic person)
- Activity: “doing housework for hours” (prolonged physical/mental effort)
- Outcome: “what might you feel” (resulting physical/emotional state)
- Relationship: Extended housework causes certain feelings/states.

3) Constraints/hints:
- Open-ended but likely expects a common, concise response.
- Most prototypical answer: a physical state due to exertion.
- Keep answer short (one word or brief phrase).

Suggested answer options (ranked by likelihood):
- Primary: “Tired.”
- Alternatives: “Exhausted,” “Sore,” “Sweaty,” “Hungry,” “Thirsty,” “Achy,” “Satisfaction/proud” (less likely).

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The Planner notes the most prototypical feeling after hours of housework is “tired,” but since that option isn’t available, the next common outcome from prolonged, repetitive chores is “boredom.” Other emotions like anger, stress, or anxiety are less directly caused by housework itself, and “not boredom” is not a plausible feeling.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. After hours of repetitive chores, boredom is a common feeling; “not boredom” is invalid, and anger/anxiety are less directly tied. Stress is possible but less typical than boredom in this context.

================================================================================

Question: The accountant used a calculator regularly, he kept one at home and one at the what?
Answers:
A. desk drawer
B. desktop
C. office
D. wristwatch
E. city hall

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Question type:
- Commonsense cloze/fill-in-the-blank completion (finish the sentence with a plausible location)

Key entities and relationships:
- Entity: “the accountant” (profession implying frequent calculator use)
- Object: “a calculator”
- Locations: “home” and a second location introduced by “the …”
- Relationship: He keeps calculators in two places where he regularly needs them

Constraints and hints:
- The phrase “used a calculator regularly” suggests both locations are places he commonly works
- Parallel structure: “at home and at the …” implies a common workplace counterpart
- Definite article “the” before the blank favors a specific, conventional workplace noun (e.g., “the office”) over forms like “work” (which typically appears without “the”)

Candidate completions (for the Solver to evaluate):
- “the office” — grammatically and contextually the most conventional pairing with “home”
- “the workplace” — possible but less idiomatic than “the office”
- “the desk” — could fit but is less parallel to “home”
- “the bank/firm” — possible if specifying employer’s site, but less general
- Exclude: “the work” (ungrammatical in this structure), “work” (missing “the” given the prompt)

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The sentence uses a parallel structure: “at home and at the …,” which commonly pairs with “office” as a standard workplace location. “At the office” is idiomatic and matches the context of an accountant needing a calculator at both home and work. The other options are awkward or contextually unlikely.

Final Answer: C

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
C

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “At home and at the office” is the most natural, idiomatic pairing. The other options are awkward with the preposition “at the” or contextually unlikely.

Question: At the end of your meal what will a waiter do?
Answers:
A. serve food
B. eat
C. set table
D. serve meal
E. present bill

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Type of question
- Common-sense everyday scenario
- Sequence/expected-next-action (procedural/temporal)
- Not a calculation or definition; seeks a typical action

2) Key entities and relationships
- Entity: waiter (service staff)
- Context: end of your meal (dining has concluded)
- Relationship: waiter performs a customary closing action in restaurant service

3) Constraints/hints
- Generic setting (no cuisine or country specified)
- “At the end of your meal” signals the closing phase of service
- Implied expected/typical action rather than an exhaustive list

4) Likely action scope (for solver to consider)
- Present/bring the check/bill
- Possibly clear dishes and/or ask about dessert/coffee, but primary expected answer is the check/bill
- May take payment after presenting the check

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Reasoning: The question asks for the typical action a waiter performs at the end of a meal. The planner notes this is a common-sense, end-of-service action. The customary step is to bring/present the check/bill. Among the options, “present bill” matches this expected action.

Final Answer: E

SOLVER ANSWER:

Question: If you aren't glad, unhappy or gloomy, what illness may you have?
Answers:
A. depressed
B. downcast
C. angry
D. unhappy
E. sorrowful

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis plan for Solver

1) Type of question
- Riddle/wordplay (lateral thinking). Seeks a specific, likely punny illness based on the wording.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Emotions listed: glad (happy), unhappy (sad), gloomy (blue).
- Common thread: these are “moods” and also map to color words (blue) and emotional states.
- The question: “If you aren’t glad, unhappy or gloomy, what illness may you have?” implies absence of these moods/feelings.

3) Constraints and hints
- Likely a single concise illness name as the punchline.
- Wordplay directions to consider:
  a) “Moods” → absence of moods → “a-mood-ia” style pun → “monotone/mono” (one mood) or “apathy.”
  b) Color hint: “gloomy/blue” → if you aren’t “blue,” maybe color-related illness like color blindness (specifically tritanopia/blue-yellow deficiency).
  c) Emotional numbness → medical/psychological term like anhedonia or apathy; but “glad, unhappy or gloomy” covers positive and negative affect, so total lack of feeling could hint “numbness/anesthesia,” which in riddles sometimes maps to “leprosy” (loss of sensation), though that’s darker.
  d) Classic riddle trope: If you have no “mood(s)” → “mono” (mononucleosis) as pun on “one” (mono) vs multiple moods (“moods swings”). Or “amoodia” → “amoebia” (amoebic) pun—less likely.
  e) Another classic: “If you aren’t happy, sad, or blue” → you can’t feel “blue” → “color blindness.” Simpler expected answer: “color blindness.”

4) Suggested answer directions for Solver
- Primary likely riddle answer: “color blindness” (since not ‘blue’/gloomy).
- Alternative punny answer: “mono” (mononucleosis), via “one mood”/no moods.
- Psychological term answer: “apathy” or “anhedonia.”
- Be ready to choose the most riddle-like, punchy illness name. The shortest, common riddle answer is “color blindness.”

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The riddle asks for an illness, and among the options only “depressed” names a recognized illness. The others are just mood descriptors, not illnesses.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Given the provided options, only "depressed" corresponds to a recognized illness (depression); the others are just mood descriptors. While the riddle-like phrasing might hint at something like "color blindness," that isn't among the choices, so A is the best fit.

Question: You can hear testimony of how spirituality changes lives when you do what?
Answers:
A. go to church
B. appear in court
C. watch soap operas
D. paying attention
E. go into court

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis and plan for the Solver:

1) Question type:
- Specific detail/condition question (when-condition). It asks for the specific action or situation under which one can hear testimony.

2) Key entities and relationships:
- Entity: testimony
- Entity: spirituality
- Concept: how spirituality changes lives
- Relationship: Conditional trigger — “You can hear testimony … when you do what?” The answer should specify the action/event that enables hearing such testimony.

3) Constraints/hints:
- The phrasing implies the answer is a concise action or event (a verb phrase), e.g., “when you [attend/listen to/visit …].”
- Likely drawn from a specific source line; use the exact or closest wording found in the source.
- Keep the answer brief and directly tied to the “when you do what” structure.

Expected answer format:
- A short verb phrase completing the sentence: “when you [action].”
- Avoid elaboration; match the source’s wording precisely if available. If multiple candidates appear, choose the most explicit condition tied to “hear testimony of how spirituality changes lives.” If the source is not provided, request the relevant context.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
The question asks under what condition you can hear testimony about how spirituality changes lives. Testimonies about spirituality are commonly shared in religious settings, making “go to church” the most fitting action among the choices. Court-related options focus on legal testimony, not spiritual testimonies, and the others are not contextually relevant.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “Testimony of how spirituality changes lives” is most commonly heard in religious settings, making “go to church” the best fit; the court-related options refer to legal testimony, not spiritual.

Question: It was a great rest, she had never felt this much what in the morning?
Answers:
A. active
B. hunger
C. in motion
D. wakefulness
E. lay down

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis

1) Question type
- Fill-in-the-blank/cloze completion focused on selecting a context-appropriate word.

2) Key entities and relationships
- Subject: “she”
- Time/context: “in the morning”
- Preceding cause: “It was a great rest”
- Effect/result to be filled: how she felt as a consequence of the great rest.

3) Constraints and hints
- The missing word should describe a positive, post-rest state.
- It should fit grammatically after “felt this much … in the morning,” implying a gradable state (commonly an adjective describing condition or energy level).
- Common collocations after good sleep include adjectives like “rested,” “refreshed,” or “energetic,” which align with the causal cue “great rest” and the time cue “in the morning.”
- The phrasing “this much” suggests a degree/intensity, so the completion should be a gradable descriptor of how she felt.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Given “It was a great rest,” the result should be a positive, post-sleep state. The phrase “this much” pairs naturally with a noun denoting a quantity. Among options, “wakefulness” is a quantifiable state that fits both the causality (good rest leads to more wakefulness) and the grammar (“felt this much wakefulness”). The other choices are ungrammatical or semantically off in this context.

----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. “Wakefulness” is the only noun that fits grammatically with “this much …” and logically follows from “a great rest,” whereas the other options are ungrammatical or semantically off.

Question: Which region has the most famous temple?
Answers:
A. jerusalem
B. jewish community
C. middle east
D. city
E. mosque

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Question type:
- Superlative/comparative identification. It asks to select one region based on a superlative attribute (“most famous”).

Key entities and relationships:
- Entities: regions; temples.
- Relationship: a temple belongs to (is located in) a region.
- Attribute: fame of temples (needs a way to determine “most famous” from the provided context/data).

What is being asked:
- Identify the single region that contains the temple described or measured as the “most famous.”

Constraints and hints:
- “Most famous” implies a comparison across all temples mentioned in the given context (e.g., passage, table, chart).
- The answer should be the region name, not the temple name.
- Fame must be determined from the provided data (explicit wording like “the most famous temple” or an implied metric such as highest visitors/popularity). Do not infer from outside knowledge.
- If multiple temples tie for “most famous,” apply any given tiebreaker in the data; if none, note ambiguity.
- If the source labels one temple as “most famous,” directly map that temple to its region.

Proposed solution steps for the Solver:
1. Parse the provided context (text/table/figure) to list all temples and their associated regions.
2. Identify the fame indicator:
   - Look for explicit superlatives (“the most famous temple”).
   - Or compute from a numeric proxy (e.g., highest visitor count/popularity score), if present.
3. Select the temple with the highest fame indicator.
4. Return the region associated with that temple as the final answer.
5. If data is insufficient or ambiguous, indicate that the region cannot be determined from the given information.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
There is no context provided listing temples and their associated regions or any fame indicator. Without such data, the region with the “most famous” temple cannot be determined from the given information.

Final Answer: Cannot be determined from the given information

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
C

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I disagree. The Solver’s reasoning says the answer cannot be determined from the given information, yet it outputs C without justification. This is inconsistent and unsupported. Given the options, “jerusalem” is the most plausible region associated with the most famous temple.

Question: Where would you find a bee gathering pollen?
Answers:
A. united states
B. sky
C. court
D. field of flowers
E. orchard

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Type of question:
- Common-sense WH-question asking for a typical location (where) associated with an action.

Key entities and relationships:
- Entity: bee
- Action: gathering pollen
- Object/context: pollen is collected from flowers
- Relationship: Bees gather pollen from flowers; flowers are typically found in places like gardens, meadows, fields.

Constraints/hints:
- Singular “Where” implies a concise, most typical location.
- No special context given, so prefer the most direct, specific answer.
- Likely expected answer: “on a flower” (alternatively “in a flower garden/meadow,” but “on a flower” is most precise).

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Bees gather pollen from flowers, and a typical place with many flowers is a field of flowers. Among the options, this is the most direct and specific location associated with pollen gathering.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Bees gather pollen from flowers, and among the options, a field of flowers is the most directly associated and typical location for that activity.

Question: Where would you put a folding chair if you do not plan to use it and you do not have any large doors in your house?
Answers:
A. roof
B. school
C. beach
D. closet
E. garage

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
Analysis for Solver

1) Question type
- Open-ended, common-sense placement decision
- Scenario-based with constraints (conditional: not using item; environmental constraint: no large doors)
- Seeks a single, typical location as the answer

2) Key entities and relationships
- Item: folding chair (portable, folds flat, intended for occasional use)
- Environment: house without large doors (implies limited clearance; excludes places like garage with big door, or behind a large door)
- Action/intent: not planning to use it now (store it out of the way)
- Relationship: choose a plausible indoor storage spot that accommodates a flat, foldable object without requiring large door access

3) Constraints/hints
- “Do not plan to use it” → place in storage/out of sight
- “Do not have any large doors” → avoid solutions that require wide/garage/shed doors or “behind the door” storage; favor standard indoor storage spaces accessible through normal-sized doors
- Folding chairs are thin → suitable for closets, under-bed, behind furniture, storage room

Guidance for answer format
- Provide a single, concise, common household location suitable for storing a folded chair indoors (e.g., a closet).

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
You’re not planning to use the folding chair, so store it out of the way. Without any large doors (making a garage or similar less applicable), a common indoor storage spot that fits a folded chair is a closet.

Final Answer: D

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
D

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. If you’re not using the folding chair, the typical indoor storage spot is a closet. Options like roof, school, and beach are inappropriate, and “garage” may be excluded by the “no large doors” hint. Closet fits well.

Question: If you're speaking to a lawyer about getting a divorce, what relationship status are you trying to end?
Answers:
A. being married
B. sisters
C. marriage
D. two people
E. lawyer

PLANNER OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------
- Question type: Common-sense inference/definition (single-answer).
- Core concept: Divorce is the legal process to end a marital relationship.
- Key entities:
  - Person speaking to a lawyer
  - Divorce (legal process)
  - Relationship status
- Relationship: Divorce terminates the state of being married (marital status).
- Likely expected answer form: A concise noun phrase indicating the status—e.g., “marriage” or “being married” (marital status: married).
- Constraints/hints: Everyday phrasing; seeks the specific relationship status being ended, not procedural details.

SOLVER REASONING:
----------------------------------------
Divorce is the legal process to end the marital relationship; the relationship status being ended is the state of being married.

Final Answer: A

SOLVER ANSWER:
----------------------------------------
A

CRITIC REASONING:
----------------------------------------
I agree with the Solver. Divorce ends the marital status; “being married” directly addresses the relationship status in question, making A the best choice over the more general “marriage.”
